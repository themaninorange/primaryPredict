2,"(CNN) J. Michael Goodson is no slouch. Remember that when you hear his claim of being duped by a Donald Trump condo project in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

It started back in 2005 when Goodson, who lives outside Princeton, New Jersey, was looking for a part-time home to live in while doing business near Miami. He admits he was enamored with the Trump Tower in Manhattan and with the developer who built it. Trump was a brand he could buy into, both for the prestige and his belief that a Trump property, no matter where it was, was bound to return a huge financial reward.

So in 2005, when Trump announced he was building a new Trump Tower in Fort Lauderdale, Goodson put down $345,000 to secure a sixth-floor unit right near the pool.

""We were given a brochure that said this was the best property he had ever developed,"" Goodson told CNN.

The brochure for the Trump International Hotel and Tower was actually a glossy picture book depicting the artists' rendering of a seaside tower with astounding ocean views, magnificent amenities and the Trump name throughout.

The book even includes a personally signed letter from Trump himself, which read, ""It is with great pleasure that I present my latest development, Trump International Hotel and Tower, Fort Lauderdale.""

Goodson still has that glossy book, but nothing else. Trump International Hotel and Tower was a failure.

The project fell victim to the property slump that hit South Florida in 2008. Two years later, the failed tower was in foreclosure and no longer bore the signature name. Donald J. Trump, it turns out, was not the developer. He had licensed his name and signed on to manage the hotel. When the project developer ran out of money, Trump took his name and walked away.

Goodson walked away with nothing to show for his $345,000 deposit and a lesson in Trump properties: When purchasing a Trump development, you better read the fine print.

In luxury real estate, few brands compete with Trump

It turns out all Donald J. Trump properties are not the same. Trump has become hugely successful building a worldwide brand synonymous with the very best in luxury living. Though Trump does in fact build many of his signature properties, he and his family have made a fortune simply licensing his name.

Developers pay money to put Trump on their buildings; they use Donald Trump and his family to sell multimillion dollar units; and in some cases, the Trump Organization manages the properties. When it all works, it's a hugely profitable arrangement for the actual developers and an almost risk-free arrangement for Trump.

Daniel Lebensohn is one of those developers. He took over a separate project the Trump Organization was developing in Hollywood, Florida. He decided to keep the Trump name on the building and pay Trump a fee every time a condominium was sold.

""They (Trump) made millions of dollars on the project by having their name associated with it,"" Lebensohn explained from his South Florida office. ""And every time there was a transaction, a condominium closed, they got paid as well.""

The Trump organization would help design, market, price and even attend launch parties to potential buyers. The one thing the Trumps did not do was put up any of their own money. And they still got a huge return.

Trump Hollywood

Trump Hollywood sold out in 18 months. Two hundred luxury condos priced between $2 million and $6 million apiece. Trump got a cut of every sale just for the use of his name.

Lebensohn calls it a brilliant business model. And one very few names in the real estate business can get away with.

""In the luxury residential sector, there are very few brands that compete.""

When asked whether his buyers, especially those who came to sales events and met Trump, thought they were buying an actual Trump Property, Lebensohn seemed unashamed to have created that illusion.

""I guess beauty is in the eye of the beholder,"" Lebensohn explained. ""I don't know what each of the buyers is thinking, but I imagine there is an association tied to it that Trump is involved, and they are.""

The lawsuit

J. Michael Goodson says there is no doubt in his mind. He says he was sold a Trump property no matter what the fine print of his contract said. That is why he sued.

The Trump Organization has had to fight similar lawsuits in Tampa, Waikiki, Baja Mexico and Toronto.

In all those suits, buyers claim, they were led to believe Trump was the developer until, of course, they found out he wasn't. Usually they found out from Trump's attorneys who pointed to the exact disclosure in the contracts the buyers had signed.

Trump has won or settled most of the lawsuits against him.

Developing doesn't mean developer

In 2013, Trump was deposed on his role in the Trump Fort Lauderdale project and in a humorous exchange, tried to explain to the judge the difference in his role in an owned Trump property and a licensed Trump property.

"" ... the word developing."" He told the judge, ""It doesn't mean that we're the developers.""

""The disclosure of the roles of the parties was very clear to anyone who would actually read them,"" says Trump attorney Alan Garten. ""Unfortunately a lot of people, probably Mr. Goodson himself, got so caught up in the frenzy of the real estate market, they thought that they were, you know, too good for the contracts.""

Lebensohn agrees. ""Let the buyer beware,"" he told CNN. ""Some Trump product is Trump product that his team is developing,"" he says. ""Some (Trump) is branding and licensing. It's in the condominium documents.""

When asked whether people who buy a $6 million condominium don't bother looking at the fine print, Lebensohn explains some don't. ""I know that sounds asinine,"" he tells CNN, ""but it's true.""

Which brings us back to Goodson and that business about not being a slouch.

Goodson is a hugely successful businessman. He manufactures computer-cleaning products in factories across the world. He has given so much money to his alma mater, Duke University, that the law library is named after him.

Yes, he is a lawyer. Did he read the fine print in his condominium purchase contract at the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Fort Lauderdale? He says he did. He argued in court that the Trump Tower's promotional materials, magazine and newspapers articles all referred to Donald J. Trump as the developer.

Trump's attorneys showed the judge the actual prospectus that specifically detailed the licensing terms of the project and that the project developer was not Donald J. Trump, no matter what the sales pitch said.

Goodson's argument was lost in the fine print, and Goodson lost in court.

3,"Starbucks is changing its rewards program, and people are not happy about it.

The company announced Monday that starting in April, customers will no longer receive one point or ""star"" per visit. Instead, patrons will receive two stars for each dollar spent. What's the problem with that? Well, Starbucks is also changing how ""gold"" status and perks are calculated.

Right now, customers receive gold status once they've earned 30 stars in a year. That's loosely equivalent to visiting Starbucks 30 times, if you don't get any bonus points along the way.

Gold members get a free food or beverage product after 12 stars.

But when the new points system launches, customers will have to earn 300 stars -- or spend close to $150 -- to reach gold status.

After that, they will need 125 stars (the equivalent to spending about $63) in exchange for a free item.

Related: Your Starbucks drink may have 25 spoons of sugar in it

The new program penalizes people who tend to spend less per visit. Regulars who buy a $2 cup of coffee, for example, will have to dish out $90 more per year to reach gold status.

The change will benefit people who spend at least $5 per visit, as they will still reach gold status in about 30 trips to Starbucks.

Starbucks says that a program based on spending has been a top customer request. But when the company announced the change, many people took to Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) to complain.

Because if you're not, investors will quickly send you to Wall Street's equivalent of the tech stock glue factory.

Witness the sad tale of Fitbit (FIT).

Fitbit -- the company known for wearable wrist bands that track steps, calories burned and heartbeats -- plunged nearly 20% Tuesday after the company said late Monday that sales and earnings for the first quarter would fall far short of analysts' forecasts.

At least 10 Wall Street analysts slashed their price targets for Fitibt on Tuesday morning following the weak guidance, according to FactSet Research.

Even though Fitibit reported strong holiday sales, investors are growing increasingly concerned that Fitbit is just another GoPro (GPRO, Tech30) -- the wearable action camera maker that has also disappointed Wall Street lately with a bleak outlook.

Both companies face intense competition from more entrenched tech giants like Apple (AAPL, Tech30) and Samsung (SSNLF).

Fitbit has made a name for itself with its Surge, Charge and Flex activity trackers. The company is also releasing a new wristband called the Alta later this year.

President Obama, Ted Cruz, Britney Spears and Ryan Reynolds have all been spotted with Fitbits on their wrists. It must be cool if Deadpool is wearing one, right?

Related: No Super Bowl bump for Fitbit

But Fitibit's new Blaze smartwatch -- which the company promoted in a somewhat bland Super Bowl commercial -- has not gotten the best reviews. It's been dubbed a me-too product in the crowded wearable tech field.

In addition to Apple and Samsung, Fitbit is also competing against larger companies like Garmin (GRMN), Under Armour (UA) and China's Huawei.

At the end of the day, companies like Fitbit and GoPro sell devices that are highly commoditized hardware products.

Sure, Fitibit technically is also selling something that's fashionable. And Fitbit has been able to charge premium prices for its products than some of its rivals, particularly in China. But that can't last forever unless your name is Apple.

Fitbit seems to recognize this. Executives said during the company's conference call with analysts on Monday that it plans to invest a lot more on research and development this year so it can develop software that will make it a digital health leader.

That may be a smart strategy for the long-term. But analysts are clearly worried about the rising R&D and marketing costs -- especially when it comes at a time that sales may be weakening.

So if the Blaze doesn't light the tech world on fire, Fitbit's stock could fall even further out of shape on Wall Street. The stock is currently hovering around $14 -- well below its initial public offering price of $20 from last year.",2016-02-23 00:00:00,"[La Monica, Paul R]"

12,"Univision is embarking on a new effort to register its Hispanic viewers and encourage them to vote in the presidential election.

The ""Vote For Your America"" initiative, to be announced Tuesday, could have far-reaching consequences. Univision, the biggest Spanish language broadcaster in the United States, is a trusted brand in millions of Hispanic homes.

The campaign will entail ads on TV and radio, editorials, voter registration drives, other local events, and a bilingual texting messaging tool. A new online voter guide will be established at YourAmerica.com.

""If you don't"" vote, ""someone else will,"" the site says. ""And you might not like who they're voting for. Vote for your ideals. Vote for your future. Vote for Your America.""

The effort will simultaneously sign up new eligible voters and make sure past voters return to the polls. Randy Falco, Univision's CEO, said in a statement that the goal is ""mobilizing the 27 million eligible Hispanic voters in the 2016 general election.""

The New York Times, which first reported on the initiative, said Univision wants to sign up ""about 3 million"" new voters, roughly the same number who are newly eligible since the 2012 election.

Univision says it is not telling its viewers who to vote for. But some Republicans are likely to view the new effort skeptically for a number of reasons.

Among them: Hispanics disproportionately vote for Democrats. One of Univision's main owners, Haim Saban, is a well-known backer of Hillary Clinton. And one of Univision's top anchors, Jorge Ramos, has publicly tussled with Donald Trump.

Related: What really happened between Ramos and Trump

Ramos has said he is simply representing his audience, which is deeply concerned about anti-immigration rhetoric.

Separately, Trump sued Univision last summer after the network canceled the telecast of his Miss USA pageant. The two sides recently settled the litigation. Ramos and Trump's representatives are now talking about a possible interview.

Falco said in a statement that the new voter campaign is about equipping ""Hispanic citizens"" with the nonpartisan information they need to participate in the political process. Its partners include the National Council of La Raza, Voto Latino, and Rock the Vote, among many others.

Univision's various television networks and web sites will promote registration deadlines and election days. The efforts ""will include voter registration drives, citizenship workshops, town hall meetings, countdowns to the primaries on-air, social media influencer outreach and community call centers, where viewers can get answers to their election-related questions each month,"" the company said.",2016-02-22 00:00:00,[Brian Stelter]

(CNN) South Carolina Congressman James Clyburn, who recently endorsed Hillary Clinton for president, told NewsOne Now in a phone interview that rival Bernie Sanders' free public college plan would hurt Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).

""If you say that you're going to have college -- free two-year college -- among public institutions, why would a student go to an HBCU? And most of which are private institutions,"" said Clyburn.

HBCUs account for less than 3% of all of the universities and colleges in the U.S., but produce 22% of bachelor's degrees earned by African-Americans, according to the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, a national organization that supports HBCUs. HBCUs are already facing serious economic difficulties due to low enrollment and tighter PLUS loan requirements that were passed by the Department of Education in 2011, according to the fund.

PLUS loans declined substantially at HBCUs in 2012 and 2013, according to the Institute of Education Sciences. That same year, enrollment also declined dramatically.

15,"(CNN) The most important numbers coming out of South Carolina's GOP primary on Saturday night weren't the 32.5% of the vote Donald Trump won, or that he was 10 points ahead of rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz.

They are 50 -- the number of delegates Trump won. And zero -- the number won by anyone else.

Trump's second primary win put him easily in first in the Republican race with 68 delegates, compared to Cruz's 11 and Rubio's nine, according to CNN's delegate estimate. It's still a fraction of the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination. Another 30 delegates are up for grabs Tuesday in Nevada's caucuses.

Headed into Super Tuesday, the remaining campaigns are both buoyed and afraid of the reality when it comes to the delegate count: A Republican could win the nomination simply through hanging into late March. The math and upcoming calendar also could end someone's chances quickly, even if they've performed well up to now. That's why Rubio and John Kasich, vying for the establishment and more moderate vote, are likely to try and stick around. And why Cruz needs to do well in the Southern states coming up soon.

""As quick as you can go down in this cycle, you can go back up,"" said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist, veteran of the Romney campaigns and CNN commentator.

Madden knows difficult primaries: He said he and his Romney 2012 colleagues printed t-shirts and hats that read, ""The Long Slog: The Road to 1,144,"" referring to the delegate total needed to win that year.

Complicating things, as he has all year, is Trump, whose strong campaign has tapped into frustrated and disaffected Americans' concerns. Should he keep winning, it's no problem. But should the race become muddled, it's possible no candidate gets to the magic number needed before the GOP convention in July.

Victory won't come quickly

Some rules put in place by the Republican National Committee prolong the process. All states voting before March 15 must award their delegates proportionally -- meaning that in theory a winning candidate could only pick up a few more delegates than his challenger.

In South Carolina, for instance, delegates were awarded by a combination of the state victory and by congressional district. But Trump won state-wide, and also in each district, so he got all 50 delegates. For all their effort, Rubio and Cruz, who won 22.5% and 22.3%, respectively, got zero delegates, something Ben Carson, who finished last and has resisted calls to drop out, gleefully pointed out.

""Dr. Ben Carson stands as one of only five candidates remaining of the original 17, and received as many delegates in South Carolina as all other candidates but the winner,"" he said in a statement Saturday night.

Voting is also spread out over months, with no more than a handful of states voting concurrently. The biggest haul is Super Tuesday, March 1, when 13 states vote, but even if a candidate were to win every one of the 665 delegates at stake it would only be about half the total needed to win the nomination. (Of course, such a sweep would serve to effectively end the race, barring disaster.)

Cruz has stumped heavily in the South and has staked his campaign on doing well on Super Tuesday, with his home state of Texas and other Southern states voting. A failure to do so could seriously imperil his chances going forward.

""If you're sitting in Cruz headquarters you want to run up the score in the South and try to get enough of an advantage in the delegate count and cross your fingers that's enough to withstand some of these winner-take-all states,"" like Florida and Ohio, which vote March 15, said Josh Putnam, a University of Georgia political scientist and expert in delegate math.

Rubio, Kasich look ahead to mid-March

Rubio and Kasich, competing in the so-called establishment lane, need to hang in to reach those moderate states where they can, in theory, pull ahead late.

Kasich's campaign, for example, has said it is looking ahead to Michigan, which votes March 8 and has 59 delegates up for grabs proportionally unless someone reaches the 50% winner-take-all threshold. But experts caution against such a strategy — drawing comparisons to Rudy Giuliani in 2008 who banked on starting his campaign in Florida, only to have the race largely out of reach by the time voting got there.

As long as candidates can convince their donors they have a chance, they can continue campaigning, as evidenced in 2012, when Sheldon Adelson's announced $20 million through a Super PAC kept Newt Gingrich alive, paying for advertising the candidate didn't have to take care of himself.

Rubio talked about the delegate math with reporters in South Carolina earlier this month, saying his campaign was looking forward to March 15, when states become winner-take-all and the race will narrow.

""I don't know how long this is going to go. Who knows. Every prediction made about this race so far has been way off,"" Rubio said. ""We're prepared to go until the delegates are decided. ... I do think delegate counts matter more than ever before.""

With Jeb Bush out of the race, Rubio's hope to corral his support from donors and power brokers and survive got a boost -- but if Kasich stays in the race through mid-March, it could prove an anchor on Rubio's neck, keeping either of them from staying competitive with the front-runner.

Putnam predicts the race based on what he calls the 50-75 rule, that the candidate leading when about 50% of the delegates are allocated is usually the one to lock the race down by the time 75% have been doled out.

That means the candidate leading after March 15 will likely win -- by April 26.

Still, there is concern that a three-person race could muddy the waters to the point that no candidate clearly wins the nomination by the convention in July, which could lead to what's called a brokered convention. And the RNC requires that a nominee win a majority of delegates in at least eight states throughout the process.

""I think it could go almost all the way to after all 50 states have weighed in,"" said Doug Heye, a CNN commentator and veteran Republican operative who served on Capitol Hill and with the RNC.",2016-02-23 00:00:00,[Tal Kopan]

18,"Cairo (CNN) Family members of a 3-year-old Egyptian boy sentenced to life in prison last week say they feel relieved after receiving assurances from officials that neither the boy nor his father will be arrested.

The boy's father, Mansour Qorany Sharara, has returned to the family home in the southern Egyptian province of Fayyoum after nearly 18 months on the run. He had been avoiding authorities who had previously detained him when they came to arrest his young son.

In a surreal verdict, a military court last week found 3-year-old Ahmed Mansour Qorany Sharara -- and 115 others -- guilty of killing three people and sabotaging public and private property during a political demonstration in January 2014.

Ahmed was 16 months old at the time of the alleged crime.

READ: Author jailed for ""sexually explicit"" writings

The guilty verdict that came out on February 16 caused an uproar.

""How could people trust justice if they see this?"" TV presenter Wael Elebrashy asked as he interviewed the boy's father in a Cairo studio on Saturday.

Ahmed was sleeping as his father held him during the interview and cried, pleading for help. Sharara said he was worried his son would be imprisoned.

Father detained for months, driven to flee

Sharara had already suffered a great deal for the bizarre charges against his child.

When the police first came to arrest Ahmed in early 2014 and realized he was a toddler, they took his father into custody instead. Sharara was detained for four months before a judge released him.

Sharara has since spent nearly a year and a half on the run, evading authorities pursuing the case against the toddler, for fear he would be arrested, he told Elebrashy.

But in the wake of the public outrage over the case, officials gave assurances that neither father nor son would be arrested again.

An aide to the interior minister phoned Elebrashy's show to say it was a case of mistaken identity. The aide, Gen. Abu Bakr Abdel Karim, promised that Ahmed and his father would not be jailed.

The military released a statement the following day saying the person wanted in the case was a 16-year-old with the same name as Ahmed, who had fled authorities.

The assurances did not completely allay the family's fears, however.

During Sharara's interview with Elebrashy, Ahmed's mother, Hemat Mostafa, phoned the TV station to say the police had just left their home after inquiring about Ahmed and his father.

""If it is true that it was a mistaken identity, why did they come to arrest the boy? Why haven't security arrested the right defendant then?"" lawyer Mahmoud Abu Kaf said to CNN.

The charges at the heart of the matter stem from a protest by supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy that took place in January 2014 and ensuing clashes in Fayyoum, according to a statement by the Egyptian military.

The boy was sentenced along with 115 defendants -- all found guilty of killing three people and sabotaging public and private property.

Lawyers of other defendants in the case had shown the court Ahmed's birth certificate in hopes of discrediting the investigations that led to their clients' arrests.

""Security submitted their investigations 24 hours after the incident took place, naming 116 defendants,"" Abu Kaf told CNN.

""We wanted to tell the judge that these are invalid investigations and our proof is the inclusion of the child, and a man who was out of the country when the incident in question took place, among the defendants,"" he added.

Mass sentencing has become common in Egyptian civilian and military courts in the wake of the ousting of Morsy, drawing criticism from the U.N. and human rights groups.

In 2014, over a thousand people were sentenced to death in two cases involving the deaths of police officers during protests. The sentences were later reduced to life sentences for most of the defendants.

""Most cases involving big events are based on investigations and no tangible evidence. We've seen cases where defendants were either deceased years before the incident or in prison when it happened,"" Abu Kaf said.",2016-02-23 00:00:00,[Sarah El Sirgany Cnn]

21,"Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump called for a boycott of Macy's after the retailer dumped his clothing line following the controversial comments he made about Mexican immigrants last year.

But Macy's (M) may be having the last laugh. For now, at least.

The company's stock was up 2.5% in late morning trading Tuesday after reporting results that topped forecasts. And Macy's is actually one of the best performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year.

Yes, sales were down 5% in the company's crucial holiday fourth quarter. That's bad. But analysts were expecting the numbers to be even worse.

Macy's did not have a good 2015 -- unlike the Donald. But the struggling company is sounding more hopeful about 2016. (Maybe it's the Marco Rubio of retail?)

CEO Terry Lundgren said that sales improved in January thanks to the cold winter weather.

Related: Macy's to cut over 4,000 jobs following poor holiday sales

Unseasonably warm temperatures late last year hurt Macy's and other department stores. They were left with unsold inventories of hats, coats, gloves and other winter apparel. Those items finally started to fly off the shelves last month.

Lundgren also reiterated that the company is talking to potential partners about maximizing the value of its real estate holdings.

Activist investor Jeff Smith of Starboard Value, who is also pushing for big changes at Yahoo (YHOO, Tech30), has been nudging Macy's to do more with its lucrative real estate properties.

The company also has plans to close underperforming Macy's and Bloomingdale's stores and lay off workers to try and get back on track.

Macy's is touting a strategy it's dubbed M.O.M. -- which stands for My Macy's (i.e. personalized shopping experiences), Omnichannel (think Internet and mobile shopping) and Magic Connections (efforts to increase customer loyalty and engagement.)

Let's be brutally honest though. This acronym is Dilbert-esque corporate mumbo jumbo jargon at its worst. You could easily call it D.U.M.B. for Desperate and Underwhelming Marketing BS. And why M.O.M.? Is the company implying that no men shop there?

It's going to take more time and effort for Macy's to win back customers. Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has hurt Macy's -- along with just about every other department store.

Fast fashion chains H&M, Forever 21 and Zara are tough competitors -- particularly on price. So are Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT).

Related: Macy's store closings could leave a trail of dead malls

During a conference call with analysts, Macy's CFO Karen Hoguet expressed confidence that the company can beat back the threat from rivals. She said the company's exclusive fashion lines give it a leg up on Amazon and other competitors.

But that seems like backwards thinking. Nowadays, many customers -- especially Millennials -- seem to favor price and convenience over brand name designs.

And even though Macy's is promising a better 2016, the company still expects overall sales will be down (partly due to store closures) and that same-store sales will fall as well. That's troubling.

""In many locations Macy's stores are simply not up to par: they are poorly merchandised, hard to shop, lack any inspiration, and have fairly mediocre customer service,"" said Neil Saunders, CEO of retail research firm Conlumino in a report.

""Macy's is increasingly running a discount operation while trying to charge traditional department store prices,"" he added.

Macy's sales could slump further if the dollar rallies again.

Related: Macy's was one of the worst stocks of 2015

The strong greenback hurt Macy's badly in 2015 with fewer tourists from Europe and Japan shopping at flagship stores like the famous one in New York's Herald Square.

Nonetheless, investors seem to have faith in Lundgren's plan. The stock is now up 20% this year. following its more than 45% plunge in 2015.

""Given our determination to rise above our disappointing 2015 performance, I have reminded my team that our setback last year is a setup for our comeback,"" said Lundgren in the company's earnings release.

24,"Elko, Nevada (CNN) This state that has long embraced its reputation as the wild west of politics is expected to embrace anti-establishment candidate Donald Trump in a blowout in the Nevada Republican caucuses Tuesday night.

In a state where only 33,000 of the state's 400,000 GOP voters turned out to caucus in 2012—a mere 7%—the campaigns of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and one-time candidate Jeb Bush got organized early, snapping up talented operatives and key endorsements, while beginning caucus trainings last fall in the hopes that a strong organization could overcome Trump's momentum.

But Trump appears to have steamrolled through all of that, dominating not just Nevada's unreliable polls, but capturing the excitement and buzz in the race with his visits here. In interviews with dozens of Republican voters across the state over the last week, many said without hesitation that they were standing firmly with Trump and had given little thought to the other Republican candidates.

That has meant a pitched battle for second place here between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who both made a final push in Reno and Nevada's rural areas on Monday. In a sign of his campaign's confidence in a strong showing, Trump held just one rally Monday in populous Clark County, dispatching his eldest son to campaign for him in Elko—the biggest town in rural northeast Nevada.

The more traditional campaigns of Cruz and Rubio, said longtime Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston, ""are very frustrated by what everyone's frustrated by: you can't talk any sense into the Trump voters, they can't turn them.""

READ: What to watch on big night in politics

""When you're hoping that those voters don't turn out, you know that your campaign is playing for second place,"" Ralston said.

Even without Trump in the mix, Nevada posed institutional challenges for all the campaigns because of the quirky rules of the GOP caucuses and the fact that the party did not maintain a reliable list of caucus-goers from 2008 and 2012.

""It's on a Tuesday night, four hours, with different start times for some of the voting in different counties,"" Ralston said. ""It's a totally goofy system: how do you get good turnout with that?""

Given that political operatives are expecting as few as 40,000 voters to turn out, there has been far less advertising in Nevada than in the other early contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

According to data from Kantar Media/CMAG, Rubio's team has spent $920,000 to Cruz's $790,000. Trump has spent about $490,000, and Carson, whose candidacy has faded, has spent about $330,000. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has spent nothing.

Before Bush exited the race, the Right to Rise super PAC that was supporting him spent $900,000 -- some of it on ads targeting Rubio.

Though most are predicting low turnout, Trump's allies see the uptick in Republican registrations here as a harbinger that could bode well for his candidacy -- bringing out first time caucus-goers. (Unlike the Democratic caucuses here last Saturday, there is no same-day registration for Republican voters at caucus sites).

READ: Republican Party math: Can Trump be beat?

It has been difficult to gauge the Trump's team level of organization here. But party officials note that his campaign has been doing caucus trainings since last year -- and could surprise political observers Tuesday night by forcing strong turnout.

Over the final days before the caucuses, Trump needled Cruz on Twitter, once again accusing him of dishonest campaign techniques and ""dirty tricks.""

The real estate magnate seized on the fact that Cruz's spokesman resigned Monday after circulating a video that inaccurately depicted Rubio as dismissing the Bible.

""This guy Cruz lies more than any human being that I've ever dealt with. Unbelievable,"" Trump said during a Monday evening rally in Las Vegas. ""He holds up the Bible and he lies. And then he holds up the Bible again and he lies.""

""The evangelicals didn't vote for him,"" Trump said, alluding to the recent South Carolina results that showed him leading Cruz with that key voting bloc. ""You know why? Because they don't like liars. They are really smart people. They don't want to vote for a liar.""

Cruz has rejected that rhetoric from Trump and dismissed his showing among evangelicals in South Carolina as the product of a ""division of opinion"" within a primary process that is ""an ongoing discussion.""

Evangelical voters are far less of a force here in Nevada where Cruz has assiduously courted the libertarian voters who once backed Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. At campaign events here, he has cast himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, who will fight for voters who want ""government the heck out of their lives."" Throwing a dart at Trump, he argued voters should reject any candidate who was willing to cut deals.

While calling Trump ""a good man,"" Cruz honed his closing argument that conservative voters belong with his campaign and that his effort is the ""one campaign that can beat Donald Trump.""

Touching on a theme he has highlighted in his ads, Cruz cited the reasoning of former President Jimmy Carter, who said he would prefer Trump over Cruz because Trump is ""completely malleable"" while Cruz ""is not malleable. He has far right-wing policies ... that would be pursued aggressively if and when he might become president.""

""I'm going to utter a sentence I have never uttered in any other context. I agree with Jimmy Carter,"" Cruz said in Elko. ""We can't get burned again.""

Glenn Beck, the conservative radio and television host backing Cruz, drove a harder-edged closing argument against Trump, calling him a bully. As the latest evidence, he cited a Trump tweet in which he threatened the Ricketts family for funding an effort to quash his candidacy.

""Today Donald Trump tweeted a threat to the owner of the Chicago Cubs,"" Beck said before introducing Cruz in Elko. ""When we have a candidate that threatens people... This is not American. This is not equal justice. This is not who were are.""

""If we give in to our anger; if we start to go down that path and we start to listen to the bullies, we lose what made us great,"" Beck said.

Rubio, for his part, avoided attacks on Trump, but told reporters during a gaggle on his plane that more than two-thirds of voters don't want Trump as their nominee and that as the field narrowed ""the alternatives to Trump will get stronger.""

READ: Marco Rubio's moment of truth in Nevada

""Donald has a base of support and if the majority of our party doesn't want him as our nominee, we'll continue to work toward consolidating that,"" Rubio said.

He joined Trump in criticizing the tactics of the Cruz campaign, stating that the circulation of the inaccurate video with him discussing the Bible was indicative of the culture of the Cruz campaign: ""The culture of that campaign is to make things up and say things that aren't true every single day,"" he told reporters in Las Vegas.

On the stump, however, Rubio largely avoided critiques of his rivals as he continually returned to the argument that he is the most electable argument on the Republican side.

""I am as conservative as anyone else in this race,"" he said in Elko. ""But I am a conservative who will win this race.""",2016-02-23 00:00:00,[Maeve Reston]

28,"Bill Gates said headlines that he supported the FBI in its legal fight with Apple went too far.

Gates has taken a decidedly more nuanced view of the issue than many others in the technology industry.

While many tech executives have voiced their full support for Apple CEO Tim Cook, the Microsoft founder said that Congress and the courts must help strike an appropriate balance between security and privacy.

""I do believe there are sets of safeguards where the government shouldn't have to be completely blind,"" Gates said in an interview on ""Bloomberg <GO>"" Tuesday morning. ""But striking that balance -- clearly the government has taken information historically and used it in ways we didn't expect, going all the way back to say the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover.""

Yet Gates said it's important not to get too caught up in the emotions following a terrorist attack. Similarly, he said that people shouldn't act to quickly after revelations of government abuse, such as when Edward Snowden revealed the scope of the NSA's bulk collection.

""It is a challenge to update the policies,"" Gates said.

Gates pushed back against the headline in a Financial Times story on Tuesday that reads, ""Bill Gates backs FBI iPhone hack request.""

""I was disappointed 'cause that doesn't state my view on this,"" Gates told Bloomberg.

In his FT interview, Gates suggested that Apple is mischaracterizing its fight against an FBI request to unlock the iPhone of deceased San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook.

""It is no different than ... should anybody ever have been able to tell the phone company to get information ... should anybody be able to get at bank records,"" the Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) founder said. ""There's no difference between information.""

Apple (AAPL, Tech30)'s Cook has vigorously opposed the FBI's demand, saying the government is asking the company to ""hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers."" Breaking into the smartphone, Cook claims, requires building a backdoor that ""could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.""

The tech industry has rallied around Apple as it resists the FBI's order. Google (GOOG), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30) have all backed the company. But Gates appears to see the issue differently.

""This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information. They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case,"" Gates said.

In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, which will air on Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET, Gates said that Apple is taking a principled stance, but it will ultimately comply with the law of the land.

""All Apple's doing is delaying the decision,"" Gates told Zakaria. ""So I don't think it's a big deal whether they gave in or didn't give in.""

FBI Director James Comey has described his agency's request as ""limited.""

""We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly,"" he said. ""That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land.""

Related: Who's taking sides on Apple vs. FBI

Gates is still on Microsoft's board of directors, but he's no longer involved in running the software giant day to day. Although the company hasn't issued its own official statement on the Apple case, it is a member of the Reform Government Surveillance alliance.

That group of companies, which also includes Yahoo (YAHOF) and AOL, put out a statement last week saying that ""technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure.""",2016-02-23 00:00:00,[Charles Riley]

(CNN) A Swedish doctor who authorities said imprisoned a woman for six days in a windowless cement bunker has been sentenced to 10 years in prison, a Stockholm district court said Tuesday.

Martin Peter Trenneborg, 38, was convicted of kidnapping after a trial in which prosecutors said he drugged the woman and then brought her to an underground bunker near his home in southern Sweden in September so that he could have a girlfriend.

Trenneborg also was charged with rape, but he was acquitted of that charge because of insufficient evidence, the court said. Authorities said Trenneborg admitted drugging the woman but denied raping her.

Stockholm chief prosecutor Peter Claeson said the woman's ordeal began in her apartment when the doctor served her chocolate-dipped strawberries that had been spiked with Rohypnol, a potent sedative known as a date-rape drug.

The German city of Hamburg has banned coffee pods from government-run buildings. In an attempt to become more environmentally friendly, the city said it will no longer spend taxpayer money on products that don't meet its high sustainability standards.

Coffee capsules, like those sold by the Nestle (NSRGY), Keurig (GMCR) and other brands, are specifically mentioned in the city's new guidelines, because they create unnecessary waste and contain aluminum. A spokesman for the city said the pods contain 3 grams of waste for every 6 grams of coffee.

But the list of prohibited items goes far beyond coffee. It includes plastic cutlery and plates, water, beer, and soft drinks in disposable packaging, as well as certain cleaning products and even wall paints.

""The city can help ensure that environmentally harmful products are purchased less frequently and that sustainable products achieve even greater acceptance in the market. Our objective is to increase the share of environmentally friendly products significantly in order to help combat climate change,"" said Hamburg senator Jens Kerstan.

Related: More plastic than fish in oceans by 2050

Capsule coffee machines have become increasingly popular in recent years, thanks to the convenience they offer. Euromonitor said pods have seen ""colossal growth"" and remain the major growth driver in the U.S. coffee market.

The National Coffee Association estimates more than quarter of U.S. households now own pod coffee makers.

But critics of the capsule coffee trend point out the pods are extremely difficult to recycle. They combine different materials, including plastic and aluminum, which can't be easily split from each other. Separating materials is crucial in the recycling process.

Some of the most popular brands behind coffee pods -- Keurig in the U.S. and Nespresso in Europe -- offer recycling options that include pick-up and drop-off service for used pods, but they don't release figures about the amount of pods that end up in landfills.

They also offer recyclable varieties of their pods, provided users are willing to do their part and separate the metal portion of the pods from the rest before recycling.

Keurig has promised to make all K-Cups recyclable, but only by 2020. ""It's a very complex challenge ... the pods must keep coffee fresh before brewing, withstand the heat and pressure during brewing, and be easily punctured with a needle as part of the brewing process,"" the company said on its website.",2016-02-23 00:00:00,[Ivana Kottasova]

Chicago (CNN) Former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman said Monday that he would be inclined to support Donald Trump if the controversial real estate mogul secures the GOP nomination.

The recall includes millions of Mars, Snickers and Milky Way chocolate bars produced in the Netherlands.

Mars Netherlands said it decided to issue the voluntary recall as a ""precautionary step"" after receiving a consumer complaint about a piece of plastic found in one of their products.

Gogo (GOGO) shares jumped nearly 10% Monday after American (AAL) dropped a lawsuit over a contract that covers 200 of its aircraft.

American has contracts with Gogo through 2018, but the airline is hoping to upgrade the 3G connections on many of its planes.

According to the terms of American's contract, if it receives a better proposal, Gogo gets a certain amount of time to make a counteroffer. The lawsuit had asked a judge to give Gogo official notice that American was considering a competing product.

American has said that ViaSat, which powers Wi-Fi on United Airlines, JetBlue and Virgin America, offers significantly faster Internet than Gogo's current service.

While Gogo did not respond to request for comment, the company said in an regulatory filing that it ""looks forward to presenting a proposal to install 2Ku, our latest satellite technology.""

Gogo's 2Ku technology uses satellites and complex onboard antennas to deliver a much better Wi-Fi experience for flyers. Airplanes equipped with 2Ku will receive a 70 megabit-per-second connection, which is about four times faster than the average home broadband connection.

""If Gogo chooses to submit a proposal in response to a competitive offering, we will evaluate it,"" said Casey Norton, communications director for American.

50,"(CNN) It didn't take long for candidates hoping to replace President Barack Obama to weigh in on his plan to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba.

Republican presidential candidate Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Tuesday he ""profoundly disagrees"" with the proposal.

""These are people, some of them are the worst of the worst. Why would we send them into our country?"" Kasich told Fox News Tuesday. ""I profoundly disagree.""

The President's plan, submitted to Congress on Tuesday, would move the majority of detainees to other countries, while moving those who are deemed too dangerous to an undetermined detention facility in the United States.

RELATED: Obama still plans to shut Guantanamo. Can he?

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio -- conflating Obama's proposal to shut the facility with turning over the Guantanamo military base, where the prison is located, Cuban government.

""We are not giving back an important naval base to an anti- American, Communist dictatorship,"" Rubio said.

""We are not going to close Guantanamo,"" he said Tuesday while on the campaign trail in Las Vegas. ""In fact, we shouldn't be releasing people there now. These are enemy combatants ... Not only are we not going to close Guantanamo, if we capture a terrorist alive, they are going to Guantanamo and we are going to find out everything they know.""

Ben Rhodes, White House deputy national security adviser, said last week the administration is not planning to return Guantanamo to Cuba, saying it ""is not on the table as a part of our discussions.""

Capitol Hill opposition

The White House is already facing opposition from Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Rubio also announced he is co-sponsoring a bill aimed at preventing the transfer of the Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay to the Cuban government. Under the Naval Station Guantanamo Bay Protection Act, the President would have to receive congressional approval before ""terminating, abandoning, or transferring the 45 square mile lease of land or waterways at the facility.""

Further complicating matters for the White House, Obama recently signed the Defense Authorization Act and a Defense appropriations measure into law, which contain provisions preventing the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. The White House is expected to say those provisions are unconstitutional.

Support from Sanders

Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who visited the prison during a 2014 trip to Cuba, lauded Obama's proposal and sought to use the issue to contrast himself against rival Hillary Clinton.

""I am encouraged to see that the President is sending Congress a plan to shut down the Guantanamo Bay prison,"" he said in a statement. ""As I have said for years, the prison at Guantanamo must be closed as quickly as possible. Others, including my opponent, have not always agreed with me.""

Here are the six things you need to know before the opening bell rings in New York:

1. Market overview: U.S. stock futures are languishing in the red following a sharp market surge on Monday.

Traders are taking their cue from the oil market, where crude futures are dipping by about 2%. Stock market moves have been heavily correlated with oil prices over the past few months.

Most European markets are in the red in early trading, though the losses are relatively muted.

Germany's DAX is suffering more than most after the Ifo business sentiment index in Europe's biggest economy fell to its lowest level in over a year. The majority of companies are pessimistic about their business outlook for the first time in six months.

In Asia, most key stock markets ended with small losses.

2. All eyes on the oil minister: Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi will be making a speech in Houston on Tuesday morning. Saudi Arabia is the world's biggest oil exporter, and agreed last week with Russia to freeze output at January levels, provided other major producers do the same.

Nobody else has signed up yet, and traders will be monitoring his speech, which is due to start at 8:50 a.m. ET.

3. Market movers -- Fitbit, Valeant and more: Shares in Fitbit (FIT) are crashing premarket. The company reported better-than-expected results over the holiday season, but investors seem to be deeply disappointed with the company's business forecasts.

Shares in Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) took a big hit overnight as the company announced it will have to restate financial results from 2014 and 2015. The company said roughly $58 million in revenue was improperly recorded in 2014 and should have been reported last year.

Valeant stock has been struggling since October when a short-selling firm accused the company of massive fraud. Federal prosecutors are investigating the way it prices and distributes drugs.

Shares in United Technologies (UTX) jumped in extended trading after the company confirmed it had been talking with Honeywell (HON) about a potential merger, but the talks were halted due to ""regulatory obstacles, customer concerns and valuation issues.""

And Standard Chartered (SCBFF) shares are declining in London after the global bank reported a loss for the year. The bank's CEO admitted the results were ""poor"" and its shares are leading the FTSE 100 index lower.

4. Earnings: Home Depot (HD), Office Depot (ODP) and Macy's (M) are some of the key companies reporting earnings before trading begins.

DreamWorks Animation (DWA) and Etsy (ETSY) are among the main firms reporting after the close.

5. Economics: A number of important economic reports will be coming out Tuesday.

The latest monthly Case-Shiller housing index will come out at 9 a.m., giving Wall Street an overview about the health of the U.S. housing market at the end of 2015. Further January home sales data will be released at 10 a.m. by the U.S. National Association of Realtors.

53,"Sister Helen Prejean, a Sister of St. Joseph, ministers to prisoners on death row. She is the author of "" Dead Man Walking ."" The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) I'm praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.

As I was writing ""The Death of Innocents,"" I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was ""taking him on"" in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, ""And I'll be right back at ya!""

In ""Innocents,"" I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O'Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams, whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the ""machinery of death.""

Scalia's experience of the ""meaning"" of capital punishment, as he described it in one of his dissenting opinions, couldn't have been more different from my own. In the marble confines of the court, he argued interpretation of Constitutional texts, while I, in state killing chambers, accompanied real human beings -- six of them -- to their deaths, which were a direct result of Scalia's interpretations.

In grasping the ""meaning"" of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.

One thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his ""originalist"" approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.

After all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives? Are not its protections of life and liberty far too precious to blindly be turned over to legal ""experts,"" every bit as prone to prejudice and blind spots as the rest of us?

I have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.

As for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.

Given what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that's an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.

In 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.

I say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie's guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie's story in""The Death of Innocents,"" taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.

Three years after Dobie's death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented. In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities -- that is with an IQ of 70 and below -- violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on ""cruel and unusual punishments.""

JUST WATCHED Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes 02:04

In his dissent, Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary's definition of ""idiot"" as ""such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is."" According to Scalia's perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court's decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia's ""idiot"" test.

My second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.

These stalwart teachers, he maintained -- unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by ""modern trends,"" as he saw it -- upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God's will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.

Thus, Scalia could not brook American bishops' increasing opposition to the death penalty, nor the opposition of Popes John Paul II and Francis -- especially Pope Francis, who must have disturbed the justice considerably in his bold appeal before Congress for global abolition of the death penalty.

At a conference in Chicago in 2002, Scalia's statements about Christian faith vis a vis the death penalty stunned me. Statements such as these:

-- ""It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States.""

-- He interpreted St. Paul's words, ""The powers that be are ordained of God,"" to mean: ""Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. ...These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times ... regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy.""

Democracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That's theocracy, not democracy.

Where was Jesus in the Justice's stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking ""an eye for an eye,"" to pray for and forgive our enemies?

In Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus' call to forgive, but not the state.

In this distorted reading, state governments as God's ministers have God's blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem ""enemy.""

It seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.

I also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people -- especially the most vulnerable among us for whom ""equal justice under law"" is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie.

56,"Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama on Tuesday called for the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility after delivering his plan to Congress to achieve a goal that has long eluded his presidency.

The blueprint comes seven years after Obama made an Oval Office vow to permanently shutter the prison for enemy combatants, but it already faces objections from Republicans and legal obstacles they have placed to transferring Guantanamo detainees to U.S. prisons.

Obama nonetheless said emptying the prison would move the country past what he described as a troubled era of wartime behavior.

""The plan we're putting forward today isn't just about closing the facility at Guantanamo. It's not just about dealing with the current group of detainees, which is a complex piece of business because of the manner in which they were originally apprehended and what happened. This is about closing a chapter in our history,"" he said during short remarks at the White House.

""Keeping this facility open is contrary to our values,"" Obama said. ""It undermines our standing in the world. It is viewed as a stain on our broader record of upholding the highest standards of rule of law.""

Obama outlined a blueprint that involves transferring the bulk of remaining detainees to other countries and moving the rest -- who can't be transferred abroad because they're deemed too dangerous -- to an as-yet-undetermined detention facility in the United States.

But Republicans in Congress wasted no time in voicing their opposition to the administration's proposal.

Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said the President's plan ""fails to provide critical details required by law,"" adding ""It is against the law -- and it will stay against the law -- to transfer terrorist detainees to American soil.""

John McCain, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, also criticized the strategy, saying it was ""not a credible plan for closing Guantanamo, let alone a coherent policy to deal with future terrorist detainees.""

U.S. officials said Tuesday morning the plan would identify 13 potential U.S. sites for transfers.

The officials added, however, that funding restrictions prevented Pentagon planners from determining precise details for converting U.S. facilities into detention centers for accused terrorists. Since current law prevents using funds to close the prison, they weren't able to conduct as thorough a cost calculation as they otherwise might have.

Options for housing prisoners in the U.S. include the federal Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado; the military prison in Leavenworth, Kansas; and the Naval Consolidated Brig in Charleston, South Carolina. Pentagon officials visited those sites last year to develop ""prototype"" plans for converting them into detention facilities.

The additional sites included in Tuesday's plan include other federal and military prisons. The closure plan does not identify a specific facility, though congressional language mandating the plan called for a location to be specified.

RELATED: Obama still plans to shut Guantanamo. Can he?

The U.S. officials Tuesday said the plan would save the U.S. government between $65 million and $85 million per year compared to housing detainees at Guantanamo.

Obama on Tuesday cited the high costs of keeping prisoners at the Cuba facility as a reason for closing the prison, in a new argument the administration is making to press the case that Guantanamo should be shut.

Most Republican lawmakers, however, remain staunchly opposed to moving detainees into the United States and insisted upon language in two bills recently signed by Obama -- the defense authorization and defense appropriations bills -- that bars the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the U.S.

Sen. John McCain, a rare Republican proponent of closing Guantanamo, still hammered Obama's plan Tuesday as a ""vague menu of options"" for reaching that goal.

""The Senate Armed Services Committee will closely scrutinize and hold hearings on the details of what the President submitted today, but we can say now with confidence that the President has missed a major chance to convince the Congress and the American people that he has a responsible plan to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility,"" McCain said.

Obama bemoaned the opposition to closing the facility, saying when he entered office there was bipartisan agreement on the issue.

""Because we had bipartisan support, I wanted to make sure that we did it right,"" Obama said in explaining why it took so long to put a plan before Congress.

""I indicated that we would need to take our time to do it in a systematic way, and that we had examined all the options,"" he continued. ""And unfortunately during that period where we were putting the pieces in place to close it, what had previously been bipartisan support suddenly became a partisan issue. Suddenly many backed off because they were worried about the politics.""

However, many Republicans -- and some Democrats -- have long been wary of closing the facility and having to transfer remaining inmates.

5 photos: Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bergdahl 5 photos: Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bergdahl Five detainees at Guantanamo Bay were transferred to Qatar in exchange for the release of Army Sgt.

Khair Ulla Said Wali Khairkhwa, seen here, was an early member of the Taliban in 1994 and was interior minister during the Taliban's rule.

Administration officials said Tuesday they were planning conversations with lawmakers in a bid to change minds, but the outcome remained hazy.

""We hope this will be the beginning of a sustained conversation,"" one official said, conceding ""it's not entirely clear on how that conversation will play out.""

While White House officials have refused to rule out unilateral action to close the Guantanamo prison -- and Obama said Tuesday he would use ""all legal tools to deal with the remaining detainees"" -- others in the administration have said firmly that current law disallows any detainee transfers onto U.S. soil.

Defense Secretary Ash Carter, whose department worked for months to compile Tuesday's plan, said on CNN last month, ""It's against the law now to establish another detention facility.""

""So, therefore, we have to get the support of Congress,"" he told ""GPS"" host Fareed Zakaria.

Attorney General Loretta Lynch echoed that sentiment in November, arguing the law ""currently doesn't allow"" detainees to be transferred to the United States, and said the option ""is not, as I am aware of, going to be contemplated, given the legal prescriptions.""

Lee Wolosky, the U.S. Special Envoy for Guantanamo Closure, said last month that the State Department hoped to transfer another 34 detainees already approved for release by this summer. U.S. officials told CNN the State Department has either concluded or is in the final stages of agreements with several countries to resettle all of the 34.

With 10 of the remaining 91 detainees expected to undergo military tribunals, that leaves another 47 detainees who could be approved by an interagency review board to be sent home or to a third country.

Last month, 10 Yemenis held at Guantanamo were released and sent to Oman. All 10 were held in U.S. custody for at least a decade without being charged. It was the largest release of prisoners at the U.S. military detention center since 2009.

RELATED: Mistaken identity keeps detainee at Guantanamo Bay

Oman has taken 20 detainees who are banned from going back to their home countries, more than any other of the 25 countries that have taken in detainees.

Another four inmates were sent away earlier last month, including an inmate released to his home country of Saudi Arabia, where the U.S. has hailed the government's rehabilitation program.

More than half of the remaining detainees are Yemeni nationals. The administration is prohibited by law from transferring Guantanamo detainees back home, given the security situation in the country. Yemen is racked by civil war and home to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Three previously released Guantanamo detainees have gone on to join AQAP since leaving the facility.

U.S. officials compare the painstaking negotiations to resettle detainees to a game of chess, with Secretary of State John Kerry, and his predecessor Hillary Clinton before him, intimately involved in the discussions.

""This is hard,"" Wolosky said in an interview with CNN. ""It's a difficult ask of the U.S. to make, to say please take these individuals whom the world has branded as terrorists. And frequently we have little to offer them in return, except the continued goodwill of the United States.""

U.S. officials expect that Obama, who is scheduled to visit Cuba next month, will be pressured by the regime there to return control of Guantanamo back to the island. A trio of Republican senators said Tuesday they were introducing a measure that would prevent Obama from ceding control of the facility back to Cuba without congressional approval.

But Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said last week that returning Guantanamo to Cuba ""is not on the table as a part of our discussions.""",2016-02-23 00:00:00,"[Elise Labott, Kevin Liptak]"

It found rate of sea rise in 1900s was ""extremely likely"" faster than in previous 27 centuries

It said without human-caused climate change, rise would have been half what it was, at most

(CNN) Scientists have modeled a history of the planet's sea levels spanning back 3,000 years, and concluded that the rate of increase last century ""was extremely likely faster than during any of the 27 previous centuries.""

Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who led the research, said in a statement on his website that he and his collaborators had determined with 95% probability that the rate of sea level increase in the 1900s was faster than during any century since at least 800 B.C.

It is not that seas rose faster before that date, he wrote -- but ""simply that the reconstruction quality isn't good enough before then"" to say so with the same level of confidence.

Moreover, the study found that without human-caused climate change, the global sea level would have ""very likely"" changed by between a 3 centimeter (1.18 inch) drop and a 7 centimeter (2.75 inch) rise over the 20th century -- rather than the 14 centimeter (5.512 inch) rise that was observed.

61,"(CNN) Ted Cruz is facing a fresh, intense and public wave of criticism about his campaign strategy from some of his highest-profile supporters, a backlash that comes as he prepares for the biggest day of his political life: Super Tuesday and its slew of Southern primary states.

The cry from surrogates, fundraisers and operatives close to the campaign is simple: be the strong conservative you are and execute an abrasive, scorched-earth campaign battle against Donald Trump.

""Stop telling us how much you like Trump personally,"" Iowa radio personality Steve Deace, one of the most visible Cruz surrogates and a man Cruz credited from the stage at his victory party, wrote in a Conservative Review op-ed. ""That's typical GOP unity speech, and people don't want typical GOP unity speech. They want their darned country back, which is why they're aligning with the most divisive, craptastic figure ever to attempt to run for president.""

""Ted needs to be the crusader against Washington that he is. That's it. Nothing more cute than that,"" tweeted Amanda Carpenter, a former top aide in Cruz's Senate office who is now a CNN contributor.

""It is time to expose Trump,"" one pro-Cruz fundraiser, granted anonymity to candidly assess the campaign, told CNN.

The worries come after Cruz finished third in South Carolina, where evangelical or born-again Christians made up 74% of the GOP electorate. Making things worse for Cruz, Trump captured all of the 50 delegates up for grabs. If Cruz can't win one delegate with demographics like that, the fears are Super Tuesday won't be much better without a change in tactics.

In the eyes of the frustrated, Cruz has been unable to effectively neutralize Rubio and turn it into a genuine two-way race. Rubio's second-place showing in South Carolina has made him into a threatening candidate who has shown the ability to drag Cruz into the mud and strip votes away from Republicans anxious about nominating Trump.

""Cruz's messaging is a muddled mess,"" Erick Erickson, a conservative commentator close to both Cruz and Rubio's campaigns who is neutral between them, wrote Monday. ""For about eight months I have said it was Cruz's race to lose. Now I think it is Rubio's race to lose. The race has shifted in Rubio's favor. Republicans want to beat Trump and Rubio is seen by many of them as the likable, electable alternative.""

And he can't completely turn away from Rubio. His advertising has been just as centered as on targeting Rubio, and Cruz's aides at times appear close to obsessed with thwarting Rubio's ascendance into a top-tier candidate.

Cruz defenders still believe the map favors them over Rubio as it heads below the Mason-Dixon Line, and his team labored on Monday to reset the narrative in the South. They blamed the media for holding Rubio to low expectations, and for holding Cruz to a high bar. Tyler, before he was fired, said Monday that South Carolina's results offered no omens in other southern states without the same ""pockets of liberalism.""

And his campaign released a memo Monday evening from chief strategist Jason Johnson. Titled ""Ted Cruz is the only candidate who can defeat Trump,"" Johnson's focus is primarily on the idea that Rubio is not positioned to take on Trump, no matter how many financial resources he has, because the Florida senator is too moderate.

""Ted Cruz is substantially outperforming Rubio, and in many cases beating Trump, for the Republican base vote. The core of the party is with Cruz and may not be with Rubio head-to-head against Trump,"" Johnson wrote. ""The battle for conservative voters is clearly between Cruz and Trump, with Cruz winning one state and Trump edging out Cruz in the other two; Rubio lags behind in all three.""

And, Cruz added to reporters Monday in Las Vegas, when other candidates attack him, it's possible they could hand Trump the nomination.

""I believe that Donald Trump will not be our nominee, but the only way to beat him is for conservatives to unite behind our campaign. If other candidates devote all their time and energy to attacking us, to engaging in personal slurs and attacks, it is possible they could weaken us to sufficient extent that they could hand Trump the nomination.""

Cruz still enjoys many advantages over the rest of the field: Cruz and his super PACs together had $38 million on hand as of Jan. 31, a $27 million advantage over Rubio and his groups that could pay dividend as the race grows expensive and national.

And Rubio is hardly on a glide path to the nomination as it enters more conservative terrain. But the Florida senator won over almost a dozen endorsements in the 48 hours after South Carolina and Bush's departure from the race.

Almost immediately after the Palmetto State disappointed Cruz's campaign, aides were quickly pointing to delegate-rich Texas as a state that would revive his southern strategy, raising the stakes for a state where early polling nevertheless shows a difficult race. Cruz's home state has always been seen as the jewel of Super Tuesday, but the increasingly urgent focus suggests narrower ambitions than the hopes of some Cruz supporters to once win 60% of the delegates up for grabs on March 1.

Nevertheless, Cruz's strategy that is now being publicly questioned like never before -- even by run-of-the-mill supporters.

Ahmed Diab, a 24-year-old grassroots Cruz supporter from Virginia, said the senator ""really disappointed me"" in South Carolina.

""To be honest, I don't see any path for Cruz to the nomination at all,"" Diab said. ""The way I see it is that the only scenario where Trump doesn't get the nomination is if Cruz dropped after Super Tuesday and Rubio started winning in a two-man race.""",2016-02-22 00:00:00,[Theodore Schleifer]

63,"(CNN) Marco Rubio has one of Nevada's best political teams on his side. He has a personal history in the state where he spent six years of his childhood. And he's picking up endorsements and donors after rival Jeb Bush dropped out of the race.

But heading into Tuesday's Nevada Republican caucuses, Rubio's best case scenario is a second place finish to Donald Trump. Again.

""It would take a miracle for him to finish any higher than second,"" said veteran Nevada journalist Jon Ralston. ""He's got a very, very good ground game run by some very smart people. ... They know what they're doing.""

RELATED: Poll shows Trump on top in Nevada

Polling in Nevada is notoriously unpredictable. But CNN's most recent poll in the Silver State put Trump way ahead of the field, with Rubio in a tenuous second place.

In the February 17 poll, which carried a margin of error of 6.5 percentage points, Trump was backed by 45% of likely GOP caucusgoers, Rubio was at 19% and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was at 17%. Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich trailed in the single digits.

Rubio said he feels good about the state and ""confident"" about the race, but doesn't take it for granted because of his connection to it.

""Obviously I have ties to Las Vegas that run deep given my time growing up here. ... but I'm not sure that's going to be enough to simply be a determinate factor in the caucus,"" Rubio said Monday in Nevada. ""I think it's going to be like every other candidate that's coming in, we're going to have to compete hard.""

Rubio would seem to be very well suited to Nevada. For his ground game, he hired Mike Slanker and Jeremy Hughes, veteran political operatives in the state who have worked with virtually every successful Republican elected official, including the rising GOP star Gov. Brian Sandoval.

Rubio's state chairman is Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, another top Nevada Republican and one of the state's most prominent Mormons.

In recent days, Rubio has picked up the support of Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who previously backed Bush, and Nevada Reps. Mark Amodei and Cresent Hardy. Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who endorsed Rubio a few weeks ago and is a Mormon, has been deployed in the state ahead of Tuesday's caucuses as well. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, also Mormon, told CNN's Manu Raju on Monday that he is also backing the Florida senator.

Rubio used a similar strategy of prominent endorsements in South Carolina, where he narrowly beat Ted Cruz for the second place spot in Saturday's primary.

But in Nevada, he can also highlight his local roots. Rubio lived in Las Vegas for a stretch of his childhood, from third to eighth grade, a fact he often mentions in his family-centric stump speech. He is also the son of Cuban immigrants -- a fact he highlights in this state, which is almost 30% Latino.

The Florida senator has been making inroads with the state's key Mormon population, in part through his endorsers. Rubio's family also briefly joined the Mormon church when he was a child, giving him familiarity with the community. In the 2012 GOP Nevada caucus, 25% of the electorate were Mormons according to entrance polls, brought out in part by Mormon candidate Mitt Romney.

""I think that Nevada is well-suited for Marco Rubio's strength, which is he appeals to a very broad section of the electorate,"" Hutchison said. ""We're not focused on one particular group. But I will say as a member of the church, Marco Rubio is very appealing to members of the Mormon faith. He talks a lot of the importance of family and how government cannot replace family. We believe very deeply that family is the most important unit in society.""

RELATED: The hunt for Bush donors

Alongside his conversations about religion, Rubio has been sprinkling talk of eminent domain into his stump speeches in recent weeks, a key issue for conservatives in a state heavy on federal lands.

Rubio's campaign strategy is built on staying in the delegate race until the other candidates drop out and he can consolidate their support. Bush bowed out Saturday out after a dismal result in South Carolina. He has yet to endorse and a handful of his donors and supporters have publicly joined the Rubio camp so far, but the campaign expects to pick up much of his support going forward.

Nevada will be Rubio's first opportunity to prove he can consolidate the establishment lane of the party, though Bush had only been polling at 1% in the Silver State and Kasich has pledged to stay in the race through early March, at least.

Anything can happen in Nevada's caucus, experts say. Turnout is notoriously low and the evening caucus set-up is confusing, introducing unpredictability and making organization all the more important.

""It's all about the ground game and all about the grassroots,"" Hutchison said. ""We've been focused on that.""",2016-02-22 00:00:00,[Tal Kopan]
64,"Washington (CNN) North Korea quietly reached out to U.S. officials through the United Nations in New York last fall to propose formal peace talks on ending the Korean War, a response to President Barack Obama's comments that the U.S. was willing to engage Pyongyang as it has with other rogue regimes, senior U.S. officials told CNN.

That effort fell short, the officials said, with the North Koreans refusing to include their nuclear program in any negotiations as the U.S. required and soon after testing a nuclear weapon.

How North Korea's nuclear program went from threats to reality

But it represented a new step from the Obama administration as it tried to lure the hermetic country out of its isolation and extend its track record of successful negotiations with nations long at odds with the United States, such as Iran and Cuba.

The U.S. told North Korea it was willing to discuss a formal peace to replace the 63-year-old armistice that ended hostilities after the Korean War, but only if efforts to curb Pyongyang's nuclear program were part of the discussions.

In doing so, the administration dropped a longstanding demand that North Korea take steps toward ""denuclearization"" before talks on a formal peace treaty began. Still, the North Koreans refused to allow the nuclear issue to be part of any talks.

""It's a tweaking of the conditions,"" said Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former deputy division chief for the CIA in South Korea, describing the administration's move.

""Rather than requiring progress on denuclearization before negotiations, it seems the administration agreed to the idea of peace talks but required denuclearization talks to be included,"" Klingner said.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on the diplomatic exchanges, but the Obama administration disputed their depiction of events, saying it was North Korea that first proposed the talks rather than the United States, which maintained its focus on ridding the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.

U.S. F-22s fly low in a show of force over South Korea

""To be clear, it was the North Koreans who proposed discussing a peace treaty,"" State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a statement. ""We carefully considered their proposal, and made clear that denuclearization had to be part of any such discussion. The North rejected our response.""

North Korea has regularly proposed peace talks over the years, pushing the U.S. to replace the 1953 armistice with a formal peace treaty, said Klingner.

""They periodically raise the idea and it never really gets far,"" he said.

One issue that complicates the effort is the need to establish parameters for any negotiations before they begin, in particular to ensure that North Korea's conventional threat to the South is defused before there's any demand to remove some of the 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea.

JUST WATCHED What weapons does North Korea have? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What weapons does North Korea have? 03:43

Those soldiers, airmen and Marines provide some deterrent to the North, a highly militarized country that maintains a standing army of 1.2 million active soldiers, 70% of whom are deployed within 100 miles of the border with South Korea, according to Klingner.

A peace treaty should only be signed after arduous negotiations to reduce the North Korean conventional force threat to South Korea, said Klingner, who has taken part in other treaty negotiations.

""You also have to implement confidence-building measures as the U.S. did in Europe,"" Klingner said, mentioning steps like advance notice of large-scale military exercises and reducing the number of North Korean forces near the demilitarized zone dividing the two Koreas.

The U.S. attempt to reach out ended definitively with North Korea's January 6 announcement that it had tested a hydrogen bomb, following nuclear weapons tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013.

Though the U.S. has expressed doubt that a hydrogen bomb was indeed tested -- with some officials instead characterizing the explosion as having perhaps contained components of such a weapon -- the U.S. responded last week with a new round of sanctions against Pyongyang.

The measures freeze the assets of anyone doing business related to North Korea's nuclear weapons programs or involved in human rights violations there.

The latest diplomatic dance between the U.S. and North Korea started in October, when Obama signaled that Washington was willing to negotiate a deal similar to the agreement reached last year with Iran, in which Tehran agreed to significantly curb its nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions being lifted.

""As my administration has shown with Iran and with Cuba, we are also prepared to engage nations with which we've had troubled histories,"" Obama said in an October 16 press conference alongside South Korean President Park Geun-hye.

""At the point where Pyongyang says, 'We're interested in seeing relief from sanctions and improved relations, and we are prepared to have a serious conversation about denuclearization,' I think it's fair to say we'll be right there at the table,"" he added.

The Obama administration at that time said it would waive the standard requirement that North Korea make progress on denuclearization before peace talks could begin, but said denuclearization had to remain on the table.

Park said South Korea was also ready to engage with Pyongyang if the regime showed it was serious about curtailing its nuclear arsenal.

North Korea may have tested components of a hydrogen bomb

""Should North Korea demonstrate a genuine willingness towards denuclearization, we reaffirm that Korea and the U.S., along with the rest of the international community, stand ready to extend cooperative measures to the North,"" she said.

A day later, North Korea rejected the idea of resuming international talks on ending its nuclear program and suggested instead that the United States negotiate a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War. Within weeks, senior administration officials said, the regime repeated the message thorough its mission to the United Nations.

In an October 17 statement published by the state-controlled Korea Central News Agency and read in part on state-run television KRT, the North Korean Foreign Ministry said past efforts to focus exclusively on international denuclearization talks had failed.

The statement said that increased diplomatic pressure and sanctions wouldn't bring North Korea to the negotiating table, but that a peace treaty could reduce tensions and make it possible to ""finally put an end to the nuclear arms race.""

""No issue in which the countries concerned, including the U.S., are interested can be settled unless a peace treaty is concluded before anything else,"" the statement said. ""If the United States insists on taking a different path, the Korean peninsula will only see our unlimited nuclear deterrent being strengthened further.""",2016-02-22 00:00:00,"[Elise Labott, Nicole Gaouette]"

69,"Washington (CNN) A pair of moderate Republican senators broke ranks with their party leaders Monday and said President Barack Obama's potential Supreme Court nomination should receive a hearing.

The No. 2 Senate Republican, John Cornyn, flatly disagreed with them, however, siding with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and GOP leaders have seized on a Joe Biden speech from 1992 to make their case.

Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, told CNN that the Senate should take the process ""one step at a time,"" but would also consider a nominee from Obama.

""For my part, it's clear that the President can send up a nominee -- regardless of where he is before he leaves office,"" Collins told CNN. ""It is the duty of the Senate, under the Constitution, to give our advice and give our consent or withhold our consent. I believe we should follow the regular order and give careful consideration to any nominee that the president may send to the Senate.""

Cornyn, a Texas Republican, was clear when asked Monday if there should be any hearings.

""No,"" he told CNN. ""My view is that this is not about the potential nominee; it's about who chooses. And I believe strongly this should be a referendum on who chooses in November.""

But Sen. Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican facing a tough re-election bid, went a step further than Collins and said that not only should a nominee get a hearing, but also a vote -- something Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has vowed to stop from happening.

""I fully expect and look forward to President Barack Obama advancing a nominee for the Senate to consider,"" Kirk wrote in an op-ed in The Chicago Sun-Times.

Kirk and Collins' stance could complicate things for McConnell as he prepares for a showdown with the White House over filling the vacancy left on the Supreme Court by Antonin Scalia.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley delivered an emphatic argument against holding hearings, citing not his own reasoning, but instead a lengthy floor speech then-Sen. Joe Biden delivered in 1992. Biden's remarks excoriate the prospect of a president submitting a nomination in an election year.

""Once the political season is under way, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over,"" Grassley said quoting the vice president, dubbing the remarks ""The Biden Rules.""

""(Biden) knows what the Senate should do. And I believe in his heart of hearts he understands why this Senate must do what he said it must do in 1992,"" Grassley said.

On Monday, the vice president's office released a statement suggesting the situations are not comparable.

""While some say that my comments in June 1992 contributed to a more politicized nomination process, they didn't prevent the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional duties, because there was no vacancy at the time. During my career on the Judiciary Committee, I ensured the prompt and fair consideration of nine Supreme Court Justices and the current Senate has a constitutional duty to do the same,"" said Biden's statement.

The vice president added that his record chairing the Senate Judiciary Committee for eight years was ""hard to beat.""

""I presided over the process that resulted in Justice Kennedy, a Reagan nominee, being confirmed to the Supreme Court in a presidential election year. I allowed the nominations of Judge Bork and Justice Thomas to proceed to the floor, even though they didn't have the support of the committee,"" he said.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid delivered a fiery floor speech Monday, teeing off the Supreme Court nomination battle that is engulfing the Senate.

""We're seeing an unprecedented attempt to hold hostage an entire branch of government,"" Reid said.

More clarity about a path forward will come on Tuesday, when there will be a special meeting of Republicans members of the Judiciary Committee, according to a Grassley aide.

The meeting will meet in the Capitol shortly before Republicans host their Tuesday lunch, a McConnell aide said.

McConnell himself told reporters he would have more to say Tuesday.

Another vulnerable GOP senator up for re-election in 2016, New Hampshire's Kelly Ayotte, said she would defer to Grassley on the question of hearings.

Meanwhile, Reid met with Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval Monday in his office, aides told CNN.

Sandoval, a moderate Republican and a former federal judge, was in town for a meeting of the National Governors Association. They discussed Sandoval's interest in a nomination, and sources familiar with the discussion say Sandoval is interested in the nomination, but Reid is not pushing the idea on him.

RELATED: Vulnerable Senate Republicans key to Supreme Court nominee's future

The political wrangling extends beyond just control of the high court, but also potentially of the Senate. Republicans hold a 54-46 seat advantage over Democrats, but Democrats would have to pick up at least four seats to win back control (assuming they keep the White House in November.) A fight over whether or not to hold a vote on an Obama nominee will likely play a role in those Senate campaigns.

Senior Democratic officials have told CNN the only way Obama wins a nomination battle is if Republicans in swing states break rank -- including Kirk and Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania.

Conversely, Senate Republicans have said that if it looks like the White House may stay in Democratic hands, they could rally conservatives.

The dynamic has already proved tricky for one of the more moderate members of the Senate Republican Conference, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. She initially said that Obama's nominee should receive a hearing, but later said Obama should hold off picking a nominee.

But some Democrats have their own concerns.

Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative West Virginia Democrat, told CNN that Democrats shouldn't tie up the floor in retaliation to a Republican blockade on a nominee.

""They know how I feel,"" he said of his party's leaders, adding that he believes there should be hearings and votes for the eventual nominee. ""Let the President do his job.""",2016-02-22 00:00:00,"[Ted Barrett, Manu Raju, Deirdre Walsh, Tom Lobianco]"

72,"Washington (CNN) It's a week away from Super Tuesday -- but tonight is a big evening for politics, too.

The menu for politics lovers starts with a Democratic town hall featuring Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders on CNN at 8 p.m. ET.

Then come the results from the Nevada Republican caucuses, where Donald Trump, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz will battle it out for first place in the last GOP election before 12 states vote next Tuesday.

Here's what to watch on an important night for both parties:

Democrats have already held their caucuses in Nevada and Clinton snatched momentum there against Sanders. The challenge for Clinton is to keep it going.

In the days since her Nevada victory, Sanders has increasingly sharpened his attacks on Clinton. He picked up on an issue he'd previously dropped, with his campaign tweeting Monday about Clinton's refusal to release her paid speeches to firms like Goldman Sachs: ""It's been 17 days, 16 hours and 32 minutes since @HillaryClinton said she would 'look into' releasing her paid speeches to Wall Street.""

Clinton still doesn't have a good answer to questions about why she gave speeches to the Wall Street firms she now says she'll be tough on -- and why she won't release the transcripts of those speeches.

It's among the reasons exit polls show Sanders continuing to trounce Clinton on the issue of credibility.

She stumbled on the issue during the last CNN Democratic town hall. Tuesday night's forum could show whether she has found a better way to answer those questions.

Sanders courts blacks

The Democratic contest in South Carolina on Saturday is all about African-American votes -- and whether Sanders, who looks all but certain to lose there, can gain enough ground to turn states with similar demographics competitive in the future.

But Sanders' message is sometimes discordant.

In an interview with BET that aired over the weekend, he accused Clinton of pandering to the African-American community by cozying up to President Barack Obama on issue after issue.

Then, Sunday night, he went to a Baptist church in West Columbia and praised Obama's legacy -- particularly the economic recovery.

He'll have to strike the right tone to make South Carolina competitive -- -- as well as southern states such as Texas, Georgia and Virginia that vote on Super Tuesday.

The key for Sanders: Connecting his core message about economic inequality to the concerns of the African-American community, under pressure from Clinton, who has portrayed him as failing to address other forms of discrimination.

Will the Trump train gain steam?

It sounds like a scene out of a movie: The billionaire Trump, on stage at The Nugget Casino Resort in Las Vegas, celebrating a campaign victory.

If that's how Tuesday night plays out at the Nevada caucuses, it'll leave Trump with three firsts and one second-place finish through the four early states -- enough that, any other year, would leave him looking set to run away with the nomination.

He still faces some challenges.

So far, Trump has benefitted from a fractured field. In New Hampshire, for instance, so-called establishment support was divided among Kasich, Bush, Rubio and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

That's no longer the case.

So the big question for the Republican front-runner on Tuesday night is whether he's somewhere near his ceiling or whether he has room to grow.

If Trump's numbers keep climbing and neither Rubio nor Cruz can stay close, he could be a runaway train bound for the Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

Rubio's rise

The nights of Rubio selling third place as a win are over.

Since Jeb Bush dropped out of the Republican race Saturday night, Rubio has quickly worked to lock down the party's establishment -- picking up former Bush donors and releasing a cascade of endorsements from governors, senators and congressmen Monday.

Though Ohio Gov. John Kasich remains in the race, Rubio appears close to locking down the party's more moderate and establishment types. It's a testament to his own political talent, but also a recognition that if the GOP is to stop Trump from winning its nomination, it's now or never.

Now, Rubio has to get voters to buy in.

The Nevada caucuses are the first test of whether Rubio can consolidate the anti-Trump forces within the GOP and become the party's clear alternative.

Timing is crucial: He needs momentum headed into the Super Tuesday swath of twelve states voting on March 1 -- and especially before March 15, when Republican contests become winner-take-all.

Can Cruz come back?

The toll of the persistent attacks from Trump and Rubio -- Cruz is a liar -- became clear Monday when the Texas senator canned Rick Tyler, his campaign's communications director.

Far from clearing up his problems, that move might have only served to underscore the complaints that Cruz's opponents have repeatedly lodged about his campaign tactics and attack ads.

Nightcap: The toll of the ""liar"" attack: Ted Cruz cans top aide Rick Tyler | Sign up

After a third-place finish in South Carolina, and under intense scrutiny, Cruz is now in jeopardy of become the odd man out of the GOP race.

The establishment is rallying around Rubio. Trump has proven he can win over Evangelicals and rock-ribbed conservatives who make up Cruz's base. So who can Cruz win?

A few hours before the rampage started Saturday, Dalton walked into Southwick's -- a gun shop in the nearby city of Plainwell, owner Jonathan Southwick said.

Dalton was a regular at the store. He smiled, laughed and hugged an employee, Southwick said.

He spent about 10 minutes in the store before purchasing a ""heavy duty"" jacket that could conceal a small pistol.

As authorities try to gather more clues about Dalton's life, they found 11 rifles at his Kalamazoo home, a law enforcement official told CNN.

The suspect is married with two children. Family members said they are bewildered about what happened.

""This type of violence has no place in our society, and we express our love and support for everyone involved,"" the Dalton family said in a statement. ""We intend to cooperate in every way that we can to help determine why and how this occurred.""

The evidence suggests the same gun

Police said the only apparent connection between the suspect and the victims was his semi-automatic pistol -- which is consistent with the shell casings found at each scene.

But the evidence didn't help in determining the motive.

""My best sense is that it was somebody who was having an issue at the time and for whatever reason they decided to do what they did,"" Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said.

The suspect will remain in jail

Dalton was charged Monday with six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight firearms charges.

He showed no emotion as the charges against him were read. At a probable cause hearing just before an arraignment, detectives testified that Dalton said he told them that he ""took peoples' lives.""

""I'd like to punch him in the face,"" Trump said, remarking that a man disrupting his rally was escorted out with a smile on his face. ""He's smiling, having a good time.""

The GOP front-runner also ratcheted up his attacks on Sen. Ted Cruz, calling his Republican presidential rival ""sick.""

Trump on Cruz: 'Something wrong with this guy'

Of Cruz, Trump took aim at the senator's campaign tactics, including the attack ads Cruz and his allies have run against Trump.

""This guy is sick. There's something wrong with this guy,"" Trump said.

Cruz's campaign has run several ads scrutinizing Trump's record on a variety of issues important to conservatives, including Trump's past support for abortion rights and stricter gun control measures.

""I missed the part where Donald challenges our facts?"" Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told CNN. ""He can't, because our ads are true -- he is not a real conservative. He can't defend his record, so like a frustrated child, he resorts to name calling.""

Trump has repeatedly slammed Cruz since the Texas senator surged in the polls ahead of the Iowa caucuses and has since ramped up his attacks on him since Cruz beat Trump in the Iowa contest.

The Texas senator, meanwhile, has criticized Trump over a range of issues, from Trump's support for abortion rights in 1999 to Trump's use of eminent domain laws for personal gain. He's also suggested that Trump, who has vowed to repeal Obamacare, supports the signature health care law, pointing to Trump's September interview with ""60 Minutes"" in which Trump said that ""everyone's got to be covered"" when asked if he supported universal health care.

Trump: 'What the hell is a caucus?'

78,"It's a rare bright spot in a very gloomy economy: South Africa's winemakers are winning new markets around the world.

Battered by the slump in demand for commodities, Africa's most developed country is teetering on the brink of recession and unemployment is rising.

But the country's winemakers have a very different story to tell. Exports were up 5% in 2015, and the industry is predicting more growth in 2016.

South Africa is the world's 7th largest wine producer. Its vineyards account for 4% of global wine output, and volumes have increased 20% over four years to about 420 million liters annually.

In a nation of beer lovers -- South Africans drink 10 times as much beer as wine -- more than half of that is destined for the export market.

The reason: local profit margins of just 2%. Global consumers on average pay four times more for a bottle of South African wine than local buyers.

The U.K., Europe and the rest of Africa are major buyers. And while China's commodity imports may have slowed, South Africa's exports of wine to the Asia powerhouse jumped 40% last year.

Related: The African nations to watch in 2016

""We'll see how the numbers go with the economic slowdown in China, but I do think the growth into Africa, into China and the U.S. specifically, is great,"" said Rico Basson, managing director of Vinpro, which represents winemakers.

China's emerging middle classes are good for sales volumes but aren't willing to pay top dollar for premium wines, according to Ntsiki Biyela, South Africa's first black female winemaker.

That's why her vineyard -- Stellekaya -- has pulled out of China to focus on more lucrative markets in the U.S.

""Texas will buy every last grape we have,"" she said, adding that Stellekaya sales volumes to the Lone Star state were up by more than 60% last year.

Related: World's most popular beer

Stellekaya has also broken into California, the heart of U.S. winemaking, and New York.

South Africa has been producing wine since 1659. It grows white wine grape varieties, including chenin blanc, chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, and red varieties include pinotage, which was created in South Africa.

Production this year has been hit by wildfires and the worst drought in 100 years, but winemakers are confident they will meet global demand.

79,"Should everything be ""smart?""

When does adding technology become more of a nuisance than convenience? I was thinking about those questions when I started testing Hush's smart earplugs.

The first thing you notice is that they don't look anything like traditional earplugs. Instead of silicone or foam, they're made of sleek white plastic, reminiscent of Apple's ear buds, with your choice of foam or rubber tips. They're small enough to lie flat in your ears so you can sleep on your side.

When you first put Hush in your ears, they work like ordinary earplugs -- they form a seal in your ear canal and do a decent job of blocking out sound. Where the magic lies, though, is in the bluetooth connection to your phone. A free companion app plays what the company calls ""soothing"" sounds that help block out a lot more noise.

Truthfully, I found some of the sounds more soothing than others. While ""White Noise"" (and variations like ""Pink Noise"" and ""Brown Noise"") were incredibly effective at blocking out noise, they really weren't very pleasant to listen to. On the other hand, sounds like ""Brook"" or ""Temple"" were calming, but didn't block out quite as much noise.

Related: Those new USB-C cords can fry your laptop

Despite their ability to play sound, these aren't wireless headphones. Hush is limited to just the 15 sounds in its app. Each is only a few seconds long, but the app downloads them to the earplugs and then loops them over and over (and over and over). This lets the earplugs break their connection with the phone and, according to Hush, gives you up to eight hours of battery life.

Yes, because the earplugs must be charged. Conveniently, this happens through their carrying case, which doubles as a charger that's plugged into the wall. The case also holds an additional battery, so the earplugs can be charged up to three more times just by storing them away -- no outlet required. (When I was testing the earplugs, the case I received wouldn't hold a charge. After receiving a new one -- that worked -- Hush said there had been a software glitch that it had since repaired.)

Related: Why your iPhone battery dies with 50% left

My favorite feature of Hush is the alarm -- a high pitched pulse, in stark contrast to the other sounds. The earplugs play it directly into your ears, which should wake even the deepest sleepers.

If this all sounds like a dream, don't throw away your noise machine just yet -- the first sets of Hush don't ship until next month, but the company says they've already received pre-orders for nearly 8,000 units.

Hush was founded in May 2014 by Daniel Lee and Daniel Lee (no, that's not a typo), after they graduated from the University of California, San Diego with engineering degrees. (A third cofounder is no longer with the company.) They've raised approximately $1 million from investors and nearly $600,000 more on Kickstarter.

So are Hush earplugs worth it? Well, the $150 pricetag is a lot more expensive than a traditional pair of earplugs. And having to charge them and sync them with your phone can be a pain. But if you can find a sound you like, Hush works a whole lot better than smooshing pieces of silicone into your ears.",2016-02-10 00:00:00,[Jack Regan]

81,"Story highlights Conservatives wanting lower spending have caused House Republicans to punt on revealing their budget plans

House Speaker Paul Ryan and Rep Tom Price of Georgia have held several listening sessions

(CNN) House Republicans are punting plans to roll out their budget until next month, amid continued pushback from conservatives about the blueprint, according to multiple House Republican aides familiar with the discussions.

The divisions inside the House GOP conference threaten to derail the process, as Speaker Paul Ryan faces the same problem his predecessor encountered -- resistance from conservatives who want to lower the overall spending level and include some major cuts to entitlement programs in the near term.

Ryan, a former Budget Chairman, and the panel's current leader, Rep. Tom Price of Georgia, have held several listening sessions on the topic with members in the House Freedom Caucus in an effort to get a consensus, but continued resistance scuttled plans for a budget release this week.

Ryan is encouraging members to agree to the topline spending level set by last year's budget deal so that the House can move ahead with spending bills, and attach key policy proposals to the budget that would set up the next president. But many House Republicans opposed that deal and want to see more aggressive cuts sooner in both discretionary and mandatory sides of the government ledger.

""The House is working to advance a balanced budget that will show our conservative vision and help us get back to regular order on appropriations bills. Members will continue to discuss the path ahead this week,"" Ryan's spokeswoman AshLee Strong told CNN.

85,"Chelsea Workman went to Ohio State University because it was her cheapest option. But she still had to take out student loans and work to make ends meet.

By the middle of her sophomore year, she'd had enough. She dropped out and moved to Germany to finish her degree where college is free.

Hunter Newsome, from California, decided to go to college in Estonia rather than the University of California, Davis -- at the very last minute. He's saving more than $10,000 a year on tuition, and he'll earn a bachelor's degree in three years rather than four.

There are at least 44 schools across Europe where Americans can earn their bachelor's degree for free, according to Jennifer Viemont, the founder of an advising service called Beyond The States.

All public colleges in Germany, Iceland, Norway and Finland are free for residents and international students. And some private schools in the European Union don't charge for tuition either. Many are going out of their way to attract foreigners by offering programs taught entirely in English.

When they do charge for tuition, the bill is paltry compared to the U.S. The average cost of tuition here (without room and board) is currently $9,410 at public colleges and $32,405 at private colleges, while a majority of programs in Europe charge less than $2,225 a year, according to Viemont. Some of the highest tuition for international students is in the Netherlands, but it still tends to be less than $9,000.

Of course, a lot of American students don't pay full price for tuition. For those getting a big scholarship at home, moving to Europe might not be that great a deal. Those at public schools end up paying less than an average of $4,000 when you account for scholarships and grants. Still, that doesn't beat free.

""The cost is what makes people think about going to college abroad, but then they start to see the other benefits like learning a new language, travel opportunities, and being prepared to work in a global economy,"" Viemont said.

It's not for everyone, though. You won't find frat parties, sorority houses, or football games overseas.

And it might not be the right fit for someone with their heart set on immediately returning home after graduating. There aren't very good stats on how many Americans are getting degrees abroad (there were 47,000 in 2012 compared to 20 million in the U.S.), let alone how employable they are back home. The unique experience might be to your advantage, but it could be hard to find fellow alumni to help with a job hunt in the States.

Overseas, you'll probably have to find your own housing. On average, room and board costs about $10,000 at American colleges, but the students CNNMoney spoke to for this story pay much less in rent in Europe.

They don't have dining halls to go to for meals, though. And they also have to apply for a residency permit or visa, and -- depending on the country -- may have to pay for health insurance.

But these things don't bother these three Americans who are currently getting their college degrees abroad.

Chelsea Workman

Studying: International Management in a 3.5- to 4- year bachelor's program.

Is it really free? She paid about $220 a semester for tuition when she first arrived, but Germany has since made tuition free at all public colleges. Now she pays a $58 administrative fee each semester, about $90 a month for health insurance. Her rent is about $330 a month.

Biggest challenge: ""You need to be prepared to study 10 hours a day, and there's probably not time for a job in addition to your studies. I take seven or eight classes a semester.""

Future plans: ""I don't really have any plans to go back to America. I don't really want to. My sister moved to Germany before me, my brother is here studying now and my dad is on the way over.""

What she misses: ""Diverse culture and food. Every restaurant here has the same food on the menu.""

Hunter Newsome

Studying: International Relations in a 3-year bachelor's program.

Why he moved: ""It was my Dad's idea and I thought, why the hell not? My Mom was skeptical at first but she started researching and found out it was going to be a lot cheaper.""

Forget spending on text books: ""Last semester I only had to have a single book and I checked it out of the school library. For some professors, a lot or all of the material is online, and for others you have to be in class to receive the knowledge.""

On finding housing: ""It could be difficult around this school, but in my case my parents helped me with that. I pay 230 euros ($256 USD) a month and have a balcony with a nice view of the forest. It's really a beautiful city.""

Hannah Remo

Studying: European studies (EU politics) in a 4-year bachelor's program.

Who she had to persuade: ""I had to sell my Dad on it. I told him if I stayed in the U.S. I'd want to go to Colorado or California, which is more or less the same plane flight from New Jersey to Europe.""

On the application: ""It was relatively painless. I had to submit my high school transcript, a recommendation, and an essay. SATs don't exist here and it's the most beautiful thing.""

Future plans: ""I 100% have my heart set on staying in Europe. I disagree with the way a lot of things are run at home. It blows my mind that college is so expensive in the U.S., it makes me think that I don't want to raise a family there.""

Favorite thing about her new home: ""Whether you're the child of a doctor, lawyer or garbage man, you'll have the same opportunity and the same education here.""",2016-02-23 00:00:00,[Katie Lobosco]

89,"Artificial intelligence will eventually solve some of the world's biggest problems -- but it'll take some smart humans to get it there.

Quoc Le, a software engineer at Google Brain, is one such human.

Google Brain focuses on ""deep learning,"" a part of artificial intelligence. Think of it as a sophisticated type of machine learning, which is the science of getting computers to learn from data.

Deep learning uses multiple layers of algorithms, called neural networks, to process images, text and sentiments quickly and efficiently.

The idea is for machines to eventually be able to make decisions as humans do. But we're far from that point today, according to a recent Quora post by Andrew Ng, a cofounder of Google Brain.

Related: She's recycling carbon dioxide and reducing oil dependence

Launched in 2011, Google Brain was originally an initiative within the secretive, futuristic Google X division. It has since graduated and is now housed in the company's research department. While Google publishes research from Brain, it remains relatively tight-lipped about the team's organizational structure. Google would not disclose how many work on the team today, citing that the teams are fluid.

34-year-old Le, who has a PhD from Stanford in computer science, has been working at Google Brain for 4.5 years.

""There's very few people in the world that actually understand how to get machines to learn and think,"" said Le, who is originally from Vietnam. ""Deep learning is still new.""

But as deep learning develops, people get more excited about its potential to tackle big problems like education or climate change. For example, using remote sensors, environmental data around the world can be tracked. Right now, that data is largely unprocessed, but deep learning could be used to understand patterns and point to solutions.

""I'm confident deep learning isn't going to 'plateau' anytime soon and that it'll continue to grow rapidly,"" Ng wrote on Quora. Ng now works as chief scientist at Baidu.

Alphabet (GOOG) -- the parent company of Google -- has integrated Google Brain technology into some of its own services. Speech recognition technology in its Android operating systems and improved photo search capabilities originated at Brain.

Google open-sourced its deep learning code, TensorFlow, to the public in a bid to help accelerate the development of artificial intelligence. In 2014, it acquired DeepMind Technologies for $650 million in a bid to beef up its own AI expertise

According to CB Insights, startups working on deep learning and artificial intelligence have raised more than $950 million in the past five years.

Google Brain alum Olcan Sercinoglu is running one of those startups. A software engineer, Sercinoglu left Google Brain in 2014 to launch Scaled Inference.

The firm is working to bring machine learning to the masses with intelligent software. It hasn't launched its product yet, but just a few months after incorporating, Sercinoglu closed $13.6 million in funding from investors like Tencent Holdings, SV Angel and Khosla Ventures.

He credits Google Brain -- which is known for its cutting-edge work -- for helping him complete such a successful round.

""I think having worked at Google Brain was a big factor,"" he said, adding that deep learning and neural networks are just one aspect of the technology his firm is developing.

Sercinoglu, 34, spent one year working on the Google Brain team, but nearly 10 years in other departments at Google. He interned at the company in 2001, working under Jeff Dean. Dean, a senior fellow at Google, was one of the original research partners behind Google Brain.

""Even back then, we were working on brains -- but that had nothing to do with machine learning,"" Sercinoglu told CNNMoney.",2016-02-22 00:00:00,[Sara Ashley O'brien]
90,"Univision is embarking on a new effort to register its Hispanic viewers and encourage them to vote in the presidential election.

The ""Vote For Your America"" initiative, to be announced Tuesday, could have far-reaching consequences. Univision, the biggest Spanish language broadcaster in the United States, is a trusted brand in millions of Hispanic homes.

The campaign will entail ads on TV and radio, editorials, voter registration drives, other local events, and a bilingual texting messaging tool. A new online voter guide will be established at YourAmerica.com.

""If you don't"" vote, ""someone else will,"" the site says. ""And you might not like who they're voting for. Vote for your ideals. Vote for your future. Vote for Your America.""

The effort will simultaneously sign up new eligible voters and make sure past voters return to the polls. Randy Falco, Univision's CEO, said in a statement that the goal is ""mobilizing the 27 million eligible Hispanic voters in the 2016 general election.""

The New York Times, which first reported on the initiative, said Univision wants to sign up ""about 3 million"" new voters, roughly the same number who are newly eligible since the 2012 election.

Univision says it is not telling its viewers who to vote for. But some Republicans are likely to view the new effort skeptically for a number of reasons.

Among them: Hispanics disproportionately vote for Democrats. One of Univision's main owners, Haim Saban, is a well-known backer of Hillary Clinton. And one of Univision's top anchors, Jorge Ramos, has publicly tussled with Donald Trump.

Ramos has said he is simply representing his audience, which is deeply concerned about anti-immigration rhetoric.

95,"Now that he's one of the five contenders left in the Republican presidential field that once numbered 17, he's finally getting exactly what he wished for -- but he's finding it can be a curse as well as a blessing.

From winning praise for his hug of a struggling young man to getting criticized for his off-key comment about women leaving their kitchens to help him campaign, Kasich has seen the highs and lows of increasingly intense scrutiny in recent days.

Monday night in Richmond, after an audience member asked whether he thought student loan interest rates are unfair, Kasich gestured at news cameras and said that before now, he'd have called those rates fair as a joke.

""Everybody's paying attention,"" he said. ""So I can't even jerk around anymore -- but I'm still going to do that.""

Even in the wake of Monday's comments about women that prompted an apology to CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Kasich's campaign is touting his off-the-cuff nature as an asset.

""What voters love about John Kasich is that he's real,"" said Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf told CNN Monday.

Schrimpf offered that the Ohio governor will not be one to watch his words.

""He's not a scripted politician who rehearses the same lines over and over or reads from a teleprompter,"" he said, digging at rival GOP candidates. ""In an era of robot-like, focused-grouped politicians, voters find Gov. Kasich refreshing. As the stage gets bigger he will continue to be who he is and we know voters are continuing to respond positively.""

Kasich's campaign has been low-key from the start. In debates, he's often relegated to the background, in the shadow of high-profile clashes between those like Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio who have topped the polls.

But at the core of his candidacy is a belief that if Republicans will eventually buy his authenticity -- the same quality the more bombastic Trump is selling with success.

Kasich was rewarded by New Hampshire voters, coming in No. 2 behind the billionaire front-runner. But he faded to the back of the pack in Saturday's South Carolina primary.

Kasich's ability to make unscripted and off-message moments memorable was on display last week at Clemson University, when he gave a long hug and whispered in the ear of a man who'd just said he was ""in a really dark place"" after a close friend's suicide, his parents' divorce and his father's loss of a job.

""I've heard about the pain of people all across this country, and what I've learned is we're going too fast in our lives,"" Kasich said after getting back on stage. ""Let's care about one another and not be disconnected and together we will rise this country.""

Kasich says he's had similar moments with voters for a while -- particularly in more than 100 New Hampshire town halls, when he would ask personal questions and get to know more about the voters who had come to his events.

""I got that guy that came from New York to say my son's got cancer I'm blaming myself, like he could have prevented it,"" he said in Columbia, South Carolina, last week. ""I mean it was unbelievable.""

But his penchant for damaging off-the-cuff moments was on display Monday in Virginia, when he recalled his 1978 campaign for a state Senate seat in Ohio.

""I didn't have anybody for me. We just got an army of people who, um, and many women, who left their kitchens to go out and go door-to-door and to put yard signs up for me,"" he said.

He was forced to walk those remarks back -- but even during a news conference in which he did just that, Kasich wasn't changing his style.

""I'm kind of a real guy and I think people want authenticity and I'm going to continue to be authentic and every once in a while, have to go back and make sure people know what I really mean when I say something,"" Kasich said.

It's true, that Kasich's mouth has gotten him into trouble even before the increased media scrutiny.

In October, when Kasich told a town hall attendee who'd objected to the idea of Social Security benefit cuts that ""you're going to have to get over it.""

That came two days after Kasich had dismissed a University of Richmond sophomore who was trying to get noticed at one of his events by saying: ""I'm sorry, I don't have any Taylor Swift tickets.""

But there will likely be a greater downside to the increased glare now that the Republican field has contracted and voters are actually going to the polls.

And so far, Kasich has found himself wandering into some curious territory, such as his riff on cupcakes and religious liberty Monday.

""I think frankly, our churches should not be forced to do anything that's not consistent with them. But if you're a cupcake maker and somebody wants a cupcake, make them a cupcake,"" he said. ""Let's not have a big lawsuit or argument over all this stuff -- move on. The next thing, you know, they might be saying, if you're divorced you shouldn't get a cupcake.""

Kasich noted the increased attention he's received in an interview Monday evening with Blitzer.

""For the first time in this campaign, people are starting to pay attention,"" Kasich said.

""For most of the time, nobody heard me. The press didn't give me any coverage. Now all of a sudden -- and I thank you today, you are giving me an opportunity to be on the air -- and my message is fundamentally lift everybody; get everybody to work together,"" he said.",2016-02-22 00:00:00,"[Cassie Spodak, Eric Bradner]"

97,"Story highlights Michael Broyde: Court picks when other party controls Senate are moderate or unpredictable

He says Obama could nominate a moderate, do a recess appointment or tap top legal mind

He says Judge Richard Posner is such a candidate, the leading intellectual light in law

Michael Broyde is a law professor at Emory University. He is not related to, nor has he ever met Judge Richard A. Posner. Like many, he has admired Posner from afar. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) The Constitution is clear: The President nominates a successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, and the Senate's consent is needed for confirmation to the Supreme Court. More than that seems to be at stake in the current political climate, however, and the contest is one of political will, rather than law.

Michael Broyde

The President may nominate any candidate he wishes, and the Senate may reject any candidate. Neither the President nor the Senate is required to give any reason for their decisions. Presidents have in the past nominated candidates widely considered mediocre or brilliant, and the Senate has rejected both mediocre and brilliant nominees.

But the recent data seem to point to a trend. Nominees to the Supreme Court made by a President when the other party controls the Senate are unpredictable and moderate.

Consider a few justices in recent memory who were nominated by a Republican President and confirmed by a Democratic Senate: President Ronald Reagan appointed Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is now the court's centrist (and voted in support of same-sex marriage last term); President George H.W. Bush appointed Justice David Souter, who became comfortably liberal; President Richard Nixon appointed Justice Harry Blackmun, who wrote the opinion in Roe v. Wade, the seminal abortion case.

Justice William Brennan, whom President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated, became a leading liberal light. Other examples could be found to suggest that justices nominated by a President and confirmed by a Senate controlled by the other party are more likely to be moderate or unpredictable. Focusing on election-year appointments might be a red herring.

98,"Bill Gates said headlines that he supported the FBI in its legal fight with Apple went too far.

Gates has taken a decidedly more nuanced view of the issue than many others in the technology industry.

While many tech executives have voiced their full support for Apple CEO Tim Cook, the Microsoft founder said that Congress and the courts must help strike an appropriate balance between security and privacy.

""I do believe there are sets of safeguards where the government shouldn't have to be completely blind,"" Gates said in an interview on ""Bloomberg <GO>"" Tuesday morning. ""But striking that balance -- clearly the government has taken information historically and used it in ways we didn't expect, going all the way back to say the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover.""

Yet Gates said it's important not to get too caught up in the emotions following a terrorist attack. Similarly, he said that people shouldn't act to quickly after revelations of government abuse, such as when Edward Snowden revealed the scope of the NSA's bulk collection.

""It is a challenge to update the policies,"" Gates said.

Gates pushed back against the headline in a Financial Times story on Tuesday that reads, ""Bill Gates backs FBI iPhone hack request.""

""I was disappointed 'cause that doesn't state my view on this,"" Gates told Bloomberg.

In his FT interview, Gates suggested that Apple is mischaracterizing its fight against an FBI request to unlock the iPhone of deceased San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook.

""It is no different than ... should anybody ever have been able to tell the phone company to get information ... should anybody be able to get at bank records,"" the Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) founder said. ""There's no difference between information.""

Apple (AAPL, Tech30)'s Cook has vigorously opposed the FBI's demand, saying the government is asking the company to ""hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers."" Breaking into the smartphone, Cook claims, requires building a backdoor that ""could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.""

The tech industry has rallied around Apple as it resists the FBI's order. Google (GOOG), Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) and Facebook (FB, Tech30) have all backed the company. But Gates appears to see the issue differently.

""This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information. They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case,"" Gates said.

In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria, which will air on Sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET, Gates said that Apple is taking a principled stance, but it will ultimately comply with the law of the land.

""All Apple's doing is delaying the decision,"" Gates told Zakaria. ""So I don't think it's a big deal whether they gave in or didn't give in.""

FBI Director James Comey has described his agency's request as ""limited.""

""We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly,"" he said. ""That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land.""

Related: Who's taking sides on Apple vs. FBI

Gates is still on Microsoft's board of directors, but he's no longer involved in running the software giant day to day. Although the company hasn't issued its own official statement on the Apple case, it is a member of the Reform Government Surveillance alliance.

That group of companies, which also includes Yahoo (YAHOF) and AOL, put out a statement last week saying that ""technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure.""",2016-02-23 00:00:00,[Charles Riley]

101,"The downing of a plane over Egypt late last year delivered a big setback to the country's economic recovery plan.

Egypt was trying to rebuild its tourism industry after the Arab Spring protests in 2011 scared off millions of visitors.

But the bomb on a Russian jet over the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in November caused another slump in tourist numbers.

""We are in agreement that this is a shock,"" Egypt's finance minister, Hany Kadry Dimian, said in an interview with CNNMoney.

The Egyptian government was doing all it could to reassure the international community that the country was safe.

""There is a negative impact, no doubt. But we hope that we will make it as short lived as possible,"" he added.

Before the terrorist attack, Egypt was hoping its economy would grow by about 5.5% in 2016.

Dimian has been forced to downgrade that target by more than a full percentage point as visitor numbers dropped to 9.3 million last year. Egypt attracted a record 14.7 million tourists in 2010, the year before the Arab Spring.

The country remains under intense security with President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi often criticized for his crackdown on domestic political opposition.

105,"Vultures. People who lent Puerto Rico money and now expect to be paid are being portrayed as greedy vultures.

But Puerto Rico's $70 billion debt crisis isn't just a battle between New York hedge funds and a cash-strapped little island.

About 30% of the debt is held by middle class Puerto Ricans like Teresa and Julio Garcia. Another 15% is held by other ""average Joe"" Americans who invested in bond funds.

""The government says the bonds are in the hands of vultures. That's not true,"" says Teresa, a life-long Puerto Rican. ""I'm not a vulture.""

The Garcias are retirees. They gush about their grandchildren. And they love Puerto Rico. Teresa was born in the city of Ponce -- ""the most beautiful place,"" she claims.

When the Garcias used their life savings to buy about $500,000 worth of Puerto Rican bonds in 2005, they thought it was a safe -- and patriotic -- investment. The bonds were AAA rated and backed by the government.

What seemed like a win-win is now a nightmare for the Garcias. They've lost over $200,000.

Many Puerto Ricans face a triple whammy of pain: their bonds are worth a lot less, their taxes are going up and their home values are plunging because of a mass population exodus from the island.

In a special investigation, CNNMoney met with numerous Puerto Rican bondholders. Their stories put a face on the crisis. The government's latest proposal to pay bondholders roughly half what they are owed would hurt hedge funds, but also regular people.

Joaquin Garcia de la Noceda is 57. He's not sure he'll ever be able to retire because of the Puerto Rican bond crisis.

In 2001, he invested about $200,000 in the bonds. He says his initial investment has fallen 60%.

De la Noceda is a locksmith, not an investment expert. His financial advisor recommended buying the bonds. Now the advisor claims, ""This is something that no one anticipated.""

""People say the rich will pay Puerto Rico's debt, but I am not rich"" says de la Noceda, who just finished paying for his daughter to attend university and is assisting his 96-year-old mother.

He and his wife run a locksmith businesses. The island's crisis is hurting that too. Companies are closing because of a prolonged recession, and the government is delaying payments that it owes businesses.

De la Noceda used to get paid within about a month of doing a job. Now it typically takes 60 to 90 days, even if he is doing work for a private company.

People of all ages bought the bonds. One was tech entrepreneur Carlos Melendez.

""I will never buy Puerto Rican bonds again,"" he told CNNMoney. He views his investment as ""basically a write off."" At age 40, he's lucky he didn't invest too much in the bonds and has time to save more.

Melendez is exactly the type of person Puerto Rico needs right now. He grew up on the island and has a law degree. Fluent in English and Spanish, he became a tech expert and worked in Minnesota for a big U.S. firm for awhile but moved back to the island.

In 2003, he co-founded the software company Wovenware, which now has 32 employees. Wovenware's offices are in San Juan's Santurce neighborhood -- the island's equivalent of Brooklyn. It's a hip area that's one of the few places visibly growing and improving.

""We decided to stay and make it work. Someone has to stay,"" says Melendez.

Carlos Alberto Ponce de Leon will turn 68 in March. He's still working -- running a small business now -- because his retirement fund has lost 60% of its value.

An engineer, de Leon worked for many years at the island's power electric utility (known as PREPA). He'll never forget going to a seminar at PREPA for people who were about to retire. He claims the folks who ran the seminar advised workers to invest in Puerto Rican bonds.

They would be ""secure"" and ""conservative."" They came with a good interest rate and special tax exemptions. Plus the workers would be ""doing this for Puerto Rico,"" much like people who U.S. bonds during World War II.

He invested several hundred thousand dollars in 2001 and added more in the following years.

""I cannot recover 40 years of work. This represents the savings of my life,"" he told CNNMoney. Today de Leon hardly ever goes out to eat. He drives a 1986 car and his work van is from 1996.

Maria Milagros Rodriguez worked all her life to build a very successful furniture business in Puerto Rico.

Around age 55, she went to UBS, one of the big banks on the island. Her financial advisor there told her to put some money into Puerto Rican bonds and some in a fixed income fund. It turns out that fund was also heavily invested in Puerto Rican bonds.

""I cry every day,"" she told CNNMoney. She has lost over $1 million. Rodriguez estimates that she has about 36% of her initial investment left. That's how much a firm recently offered her to buy her stake.

""We have worked hard and honestly. They have robbed us of what we have,"" says Maria.

She and her husband Gabriel are focused on their children and grandchildren. Her daughter has health issues, so she is trying to support her and the little ones.

""I don't spend. I give it all to my grandchildren,"" says Rodriguez.

The Garcias have been married for almost half a century. They finish each other sentences. Both worked all their lives, Teresa as a chemist for Pfizer and Monsanto and Julio as an accountant for the government.

""All of our savings were invested with UBS in Puerto Rican bonds. We were expecting that with Social Security and our bond earnings, we would have enough money to be OK and secure,"" says Julio Garcia, age 77.

The value of their bonds has dropped in half. Fortunately, they did have other investments, but the majority of their retirement savings was in Puerto Rican debt. Today they receive about $1,000 less than what they expected each month.

It means they don't go out to movies or dinner much. They save to see their grandchildren in Arizona. Their children moved there because there weren't any jobs on the island for them.

""I have been many places -- Europe, Canada, the U.S., other islands. Still, I find Puerto Rico so beautiful. It's so sad to see Puerto Rico go down hill like this,"" says Teresa, who will soon turn 70.",2016-02-22 00:00:00,[Heather Long]
106,"Story highlights Major Republican donors are concerned about Donald Trump's continued wins

The Kasich campaign says they have not had anyone yet suggest that the governor should drop out

Washington (CNN) Some major Republican donors, concerned about Donald Trump's early contest wins, are looking to clear the field some more for Marco Rubio and intend in the next few days to privately urge John Kasich to drop out, according to a major GOP bundler.

Kasich told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room"" that he was confident about his financial position and his path to victory.

""I haven't heard from any of the special interests to get me to drop out,"" Kasich said Monday. ""We're signing up some significant Republican fundraisers and our political organization is expanding as well.""

Rubio has already benefited from the exit of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush from the presidential campaign on Saturday, which freed up many establishment donors and politicians to quickly back him.

Many donors are nervous about nominating either Trump, who notched massive wins in New Hampshire and South Carolina, or Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who won a narrow victory in Iowa.

108,"Story highlights Clinton told the audience at the hilltop home that she was ""feeling very good"" about the state of her campaign

The former secretary of state noted her win in Nevada

Los Angeles (CNN) Hillary Clinton told an audience at a closed California fundraiser Monday that the top reason to defeat Republican front-runner Donald Trump in November is because of how his presidency would negatively impact the security of United States.

""There are a number of reasons to defeat Donald Trump, but chief among them is security,"" Clinton said after a long riff about how Trump's pitch to ban Muslims and other comments make it harder to work with Middle East nations and fight terrorism.

Clinton's blunt comment, while casting Trump as a risk to the nation's security, also leans into the chance that Trump could end up as the Republican standard bearer.

Trump handily won the South Carolina primary on Saturday, his second victory in his party's nominating process.

Clinton did not mention another Republican by name at the $2,700-a-head fundraiser but repeatedly hit the party writ large.

In a dusty town halfway between Las Vegas and Death Valley, a municipality where prostitution is legal and citizens recently voted to remove most of the Town Board's power, it's a part of the Old West where Cruz hopes to consolidate his party's libertarian wing.

110,"Starbucks is changing its rewards program, and people are not happy about it.

The company announced Monday that starting in April, customers will no longer receive one point or ""star"" per visit. Instead, patrons will receive two stars for each dollar spent. What's the problem with that? Well, Starbucks is also changing how ""gold"" status and perks are calculated.

Right now, customers receive gold status once they've earned 30 stars in a year. That's loosely equivalent to visiting Starbucks 30 times, if you don't get any bonus points along the way.

Gold members get a free food or beverage product after 12 stars.

But when the new points system launches, customers will have to earn 300 stars -- or spend close to $150 -- to reach gold status.

After that, they will need 125 stars (the equivalent to spending about $63) in exchange for a free item.

Related: Your Starbucks drink may have 25 spoons of sugar in it

The new program penalizes people who tend to spend less per visit. Regulars who buy a $2 cup of coffee, for example, will have to dish out $90 more per year to reach gold status.

The change will benefit people who spend at least $5 per visit, as they will still reach gold status in about 30 trips to Starbucks.

Starbucks says that a program based on spending has been a top customer request. But when the company announced the change, many people took to Twitter (TWTR, Tech30) to complain.

@Starbucks Right now I spend about $24 before I get a reward, now I have to spend $62.50 to get enough for a reward?!?!? This is bull! — Tayler Gammon (@TheTaylerGammon) February 22, 2016

This will be the most significant change to Starbucks' rewards program since its launch in 2009. A Starbucks (SBUX) spokeswoman told CNNMoney that the company is aware of the reactions on social media and is ""always listening to customer feedback.""

Washington (CNN) Ben Carson suggested that if elected president he might be the first African-American to hold the position noting, President Barack Obama was ""raised white"" and outside of the United States.

""He's an 'African' American. He was, you know, raised white. Many of his formative years were spent in Indonesia.

114,"Trash belongs in the garbage bin.

It's a simple civic lesson that has frustrated two Mumbai entrepreneurs for years.

""India is a country where people love to break the rules,"" said Raj Desai, cofounder of startup ThinkScream.

""We see it on the roads where no one is driving in their lane. We see it in the way people disrespect public spaces by throwing garbage anywhere that they want to.""

So Desai and cofounder Pratik Agarwal had an idea: Reward people for throwing things away.

Related: Inside Mumbai's colorful taxis

The idea for the smart garbage can came about at a popular Bangalore music festival in 2013.

""Pratik and I got lost and it took us two hours to find each other,"" said Desai. ""It struck us that we needed to come up with a solution for people to stay connected at these events.""

They were also struck by the massive amounts of trash everywhere.

So Desai and Agarwal, both 26, invented a trash can that rewards people with 15 minutes of free Wi-Fi every time they throw something away.

The plastic bin (which costs about $1,470) is four-and-a-half feet high with an LED screen. When you throw something in it, the screen flashes a unique code to access 15 minutes of Wi-Fi (which works within a 50 meter radius).

ThinkScream partnered with a local telecom company and debuted six smart bins at a music festival in 2014.

Since then, the startup has received a number of inquiries from companies who see it as a viral branding opportunity, Desai said.

""But that wasn't our intention,"" he said. ""It wasn't a gimmick. It was meant to be a catalyst for the public to change their behavior and stop littering.""

Related: Delhi to revive car restrictions in effort to clean air

Using technology to change behavior is what Desai and Agarwal set out to accomplish when they launched their startup in 2012.

ThinkScream comes up with innovative ways to provide Wi-Fi to Indian consumers.

Its flagship product, customized for movie theaters in Mumbai, allowed people to use Wi-Fi to order food from the concession stand and and have it delivered to their seats. They rolled it out into 60 theaters in Mumbai. ThinkScream has also partnered with music festival organizers to provide attendees with easy Wi-Fi access.

How successful are the bins? It's too early to tell, said Desai.

""We haven't done a before-and-after analysis yet, but anecdotally we know that people do like to use the bin for the wow factor at first and then for the free WiFi,"" he said.

ThinkScream doesn't have any smart bins currently deployed (although there are a few test bins at events and colleges). But Desai is encouraged that private companies and government agencies have reached out to see how the bins can be deployed in large cities like Mumbai.

Mumbai, Desai's hometown, is India's most populous city with more than 18 million residents.

It is also the world's fifth top producer of solid waste, according to a May 2015 report by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The city generates over 7,000 tonnes of solid waste daily, according to India's Central Pollution Board Control agency. And a lot of that waste isn't properly contained in trash bins.

""It's unhealthy and can lead to diseases,"" said Desai.

Related: This plastic toilet could save lives

The free Wi-Fi could entice people in urban settings where more residents have access to mobile devices. But what about rural areas?

Desai said he's already thought about how to tweak the bin's design.

""Instead of free Wi-Fi, we'll use an interactive image of a celebrity,"" he said. One example: Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar.

""The LED screen could show a photo of Tendulkar frowning. But he'll smile if you throw trash in the bin,"" said Desai.

Desai wants to soon have his smart trash cans around India -- everything from movie theaters and malls to public spaces and rural communities.

""This is just one way to help change the mindset of people in India,"" said Desai. ""We just hope that bureaucracy doesn't slow us down.""",2016-02-23 00:00:00,[Parija Kavilanz]

Ford (F), GE (GE), IBM (IBM, Tech30) and Goldman Sachs (GS), as well as U.K. engineering icon Rolls Royce (RYCEY) and fashion label Burberry (BBRYF) signed an open letter declaring that Brexit would be bad for Britain.

""Business needs unrestricted access to the European market of 500 million people in order to continue to grow, invest and create jobs,"" the companies said in the letter to The Times newspaper.

Other big names to declare that Britain is better off inside the bloc include HSBC (HSBC), BP (BP) and Siemens (SIEGY).

The letter was signed by more than a third of all companies listed on the FTSE 100, London's main stock market index, and dozens of other smaller firms. Together, they employ more than one million people across the U.K.

""We believe that leaving the EU would deter investment and threaten jobs. It would put the economy at risk,"" they said.

Brexit vote: A short guide to the next four months

Britain will vote on June 23 whether to stay in the European Union. Opinion polls show Europe's second biggest economy is deeply divided over the issue, with large numbers of voters still undecided.

Many businesses and investors are worried about the possible economic fallout if Britain decides to leave. Several large banks have already spoken out in favor of Britain staying in the EU. They're worried about the impact of Brexit on trade, investment and financial services.

Leave.EU, one of the groups campaigning for Brexit, dismissed Tuesday's letter, claiming chairmen and chief executives of big companies were pressured by Prime Minister David Cameron to sign it.

""Numerous large multinational businesses like JCB, Toyota (TM), Nissan (NSANF), Vauxhall, Airbus (EADSY) among others have, over recent months, confirmed without pressure from the [prime minister], that Brexit would make no difference to their U.K. investment plans or U.K. job numbers,"" said Richard Tice, co-founder of Leave.EU.

Airbus Group UK did sign the anti-Brexit letter, however, and Nissan -- which did not -- said its preference was for Britain to remain in the EU.

""Our preference as a business is, of course, that the U.K. stays within Europe - it makes the most sense for jobs, trade and costs,"" said Nissan chairman and CEO Carlos Ghosn.

Other big British businesses have decided to remain neutral, including retail chain Tesco (TESO).

119,"Credit card issuers are in such fierce competition these days to attract new customers that most have started offering sweetheart deals to win you over, like ultra-long 0% introductory APR interest periods. By transferring your balance onto one of these cards, you immediately stop all interest charges during the introductory period.

For example, the Chase Slate offers 15 months at 0% APR, so during that entire 15 month intro period, you pay nothing in interest on any balance transfered. That could literally result in thousands of dollars in savings, and is simply a no brainer. With these offers out there, it just makes absolutely no sense to continue to pay credit card interest on your current balances.

Well, without further ado, here are the cards offering great balance transfer specials...

The No Transfer-Fee Card

Pros: No balance transfer fee and 15 months 0% intro APR means this is essentially a 15-month free ""loan"". Normally you have to go to family in order to get a free loan like that! Good credit required as opposed to excellent, so it's a bit easier to get in.

Cons: There is no significant rewards program. This card is all about saving money on balance transfers.

The Verdict: If you don't need the entire 18 months offered by the BankAmericard®, this can be more efficient since it doesn't have a balance transfer fee. No transfer fee and no annual fee, combined with the 0% intro APR means that this is really free money for the 15 month term, no catches.

Most Appropriate For: Those who want a no-fee way to stop paying interest, and possibly pay off their cards during that breather. Those with good rather than excellent credit.

Least Appropriate For: Those who know they will carry their card balances for much longer than 15 months. Those who pay off their balances every month.

Credit Required: Good/Excellent

More Details >

The No Interest Until 2017 Balance-Transfer Card

Pros: If you transfer your current balance onto the BankAmericard® Credit Card, you won't have to pay any further interest on that balance until well into 2017. The card features an unbelievable 18-month 0% APR period, which is the longest interest-free intro period here. If your goal is to stop paying interest for as long as possible, then this is your card.

Cons: The card does charge a 3% balance transfer fee.

The Verdict: Getting a loan this cheaply for this long is pretty amazing. If you're carrying a balance, and realistically you know you will have to carry that balance for a while, this card becomes a no-brainer. As an example, assume you have a $10,000 balance on your current cards at a 15% rate. Over the 18 month term, you would have paid $2,522 in interest.* Switching to this card would cost $300 in fees, but then nothing the rest of the way, for a net savings of $2,222. Not bad, you could do a lot with that extra cash.

Most Appropriate For: Those who have large balances and know they will have large balances for an extended time.

Least Appropriate For: Those who pay off their balances every month or every few months.

The Cards Which Not Only Don't Charge, But Actually PAY you.

Capital One® Quicksilver® Cash Rewards Card 0% on Balance Transfers until November 2016, 1.5% Cash Back Rewards Program. $100 Bonus. No annual fee.

Pros: Capital One's Quicksilver card makes things simple: you earn 1.5% cash back on all your purchases, with no limit and no category restrictions or games. We included the card in our balance transfer list because it offers 0% intro APR until November 2016 on all balances transferred.

Cons: Does charge a 3% balance transfer fee. Requires good credit to get in.

The Verdict: If you're looking to transfer a balance and make some purchases, you can use this card to avoid paying interest during the intro period AND earn cash rewards.

Most Appropriate For: Anyone who might make some large purchases in the near future, or regularly charges a lot on their cards. Making the charges on the Quicksilver would earn cash back but not require any interest during the intro period.

Credit Required: Good/Excellent

Pros: Chase is temporarily offering a fantastic deal on this card. If you charge $500 on it in the first 3 months, you'll earn a $150 bonus. Combine that with the 1% standard cash back feature, plus 5% cash back in certain rotating spending categories per quarter (at the time of this writing it includes restaurants) and this card really starts to pay. All this and you get 15 months of 0% intro APR, and it requires good, not excellent credit, making it easier to get in.

Cons: Charges a 3% balance transfer fee.

The Verdict: A great combination of 0% intro APR, solid cash-back rewards, an attractive limited-time bonus offer while only requiring good credit.

Most Appropriate For: Those with good credit seeking a daily-use card offering great cash back rewards and 0% intro APR. Best for new charges.

Least Appropriate For: Balance transfers, as it charges the 3% fee while offering no more free term than the Slate (which has no transfer fee) and not as much as the Simplicity (if you were to pay a fee, you might as well get the full 21 months of the Simplicity)

120,"St. Joseph, Louisiana (CNN) Garrett Boyte's first clue that something was wrong came the day he moved to town.

He showed up for his new job at Christ Episcopal Church in St. Joseph, Louisiana, and saw a note on the refrigerator door: ""Don't drink the water.""

Then came his welcome gift: A case of bottled water.

""I said, 'Well surely it can't be that bad,'"" said Boyte, now 23. ""I turned (the water) on, and it came out yellow.""

Not much has changed in the 20 months since. About once a week -- Boyte never knows when -- his shower spews putrid yellow or brown water, he said.

Across town, the water in Elvadus Fields' house is so dirty he won't wash his clothes in it. Every week, he and his wife drive 45 miles to a laundromat, where they know the water won't stain their clothes brown.

St. Joseph resident Garrett Boyte shows what came out of his bathtub faucet in late January.

""The water is just terrible and unbearable,"" Fields said. ""I can't quite understand why we have such trouble here in St. Joe.""

Concerns about water safety escalated nationwide after reports of lead poisoning from the tap water in Flint, Michigan. Pediatricians say they believe children with elevated levels of lead in Flint will suffer lifelong consequences.

In Flint, a temporary switch of the water source coincided with the high lead levels. Aging water pipes played a role in the lead crisis, as did the failure to add an anti-corrosive agent to protect the water.

How to test for lead in your home water supply

St. Joseph's situation is different: Its water hasn't tested positive for high amounts of lead. Instead, it has tested positive for high levels of iron, which is not considered to be a serious health risk.

But the problem in the northeastern Louisiana town represents a broader issue in cities across the country: water that is legally safe but often looks disgusting.

Anxiety permeates the town of 1,100. Like Flint, the water pipes are old -- in St. Joseph's case, about 90 years old. Like Flint, most of the town is black, and at least one-third of the town falls under the poverty line. And like in Flint, residents say they're frustrated with the pace of government action in fixing the water.

Some St. Joseph residents say they've seen brown or yellow water sporadically for a few years; others say the problem goes back 10 years.

Louisiana has committed millions of dollars to fix the problem in St. Joseph -- but the town can't access the money due to missing paperwork, state officials say.

Even after washing the dishes, Garrett Boyte says, the silverware is crusted with sediment.

So the residents wait and worry, wondering what their water will do to them.

State Health Officer Dr. Jimmy Guidry said tests have not found dangerous amounts of chemicals in St. Joseph's water.

It's safe, he says -- but he wouldn't drink it.

Bathing in brown water

In St. Joseph, taking a shower could leave you dirtier than not showering at all.

""Last week, I was taking a shower, and in the middle of my shower, the water turned brown,"" Boyte said. ""And I had shampoo in my hair, so I had to finish.""

A few hours later, he noticed rust-colored streaks covering his towel.

""And I'm thinking, this is what I bathe in,"" he said. ""This is the life that we have here.""

Glynis Watson Cephus, left, makes coffee with bottled water. Her daughter Sydney Cephus and granddaughter Hailey Birdon don't drink the tap water, either.

High school teacher Glynis Watson Cephus adds bleach to her bath water -- even though she's not sure whether that's safe.

""You're taking a chance bathing in it and washing your clothes,"" she said of the tap water. ""I don't wash my white clothes in it.""

Cephus, 52, has lived in St. Joseph her entire life. ""It's quiet. It's a good place to raise children,"" she said. But she won't let her 5-year-old granddaughter taste the tap water.

Glynis Watson Cephus only uses bottled water for cooking, including for rinsing chicken and boiling pasta.

The water runs fairly clear several days a week. Yet even on good days, Boyte said, ""it smells like metal most of the time.""

No one has reported getting sick directly from the water -- but then again, no one interviewed in St. Joseph said they dared to drink the tap water or to brush their teeth with it.

Fields, 79, said he can't stand to bathe more than three times a week.

""That's not healthy for me. I'm not accustomed to that,"" he said. ""But that's the best I can do.""

Fields retired after 32 years as a county agricultural agent. He now spends his days ranching and tending to his show cow, Snow.

Snow is the only one in the family drinking water from the tap.

So what's in the water?

The nonprofit Environmental Working Group's last report on national drinking water revealed 316 contaminants in water supplied to 256 million Americans in 45 states. The group last updated the database in 2009; it is now updating the database.

But many contaminants don't pose serious health risks.

On some days, the tap water in St. Joseph is the same rusty color as the water tower.

In St. Joseph, the state health officer said, the cause of brown water is likely iron -- a chemical element with no federal limits.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency divides water contaminants into two categories:

1) Those that pose a health risk and therefore have legal limits. Arsenic, uranium and lead -- the contaminant causing problems in Flint -- fall under this category.

2) Those that don't pose a serious health risk but can make drinking water look, smell, or taste bad. This category, which includes iron, manganese and sulfate, does not have legal limits.

The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals said tests of St. Joseph's water in 2013 found iron levels of 9.74 milligrams per liter -- 32 times higher than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends.

Garrett Boyte saves bottles of tap water collected from his faucet. The one on the right shows sediment at the bottom; the bottle on the left was recently shaken.

The average lethal dose of iron is 200-250 mg per kilogram of body weight, the World Health Organization said. In other words, a 150-pound (68-kilogram) person's body would have to have at least 13,600 milligrams of iron -- the amount found in about 1,400 liters of St. Joseph's tap water --- to have grave consequences.

As for bathing, those sensitive to iron could get a rash, the state health official said.

Louisiana State Health Officer Jimmy Guidry says the water in St. Joseph is safe, but he wouldn't drink it.

""But it's not the same thing as if there was bacteria, and they had an open wound,"" Guidry said. ""The iron probably wouldn't cause a whole lot of problems.""

Still, the state health officer said he wouldn't pour himself a glass in St. Joseph.

""I wouldn't choose to drink it just because I know that it's not aesthetically pleasing,"" Guidry said. ""If you were to get in a bathtub with brown water, you're not going to feel like you're clean, because the water doesn't look clean.""

Who's to blame?

To solve the water problem, St. Joseph needs $8 million to replace old pipes and pumps, Louisiana's health department said, citing the town's engineering firm. State legislators committed $6 million last year to do just that, said Sharon Gilmore, legislative assistant to state Sen. Francis Thompson.

But to get state money, cities must be up to date on their financial audits, Gilmore said. And St. Joseph Mayor Edward Brown hasn't turned in his audit for the 2015 fiscal year that ended last June 30.

Cities and towns have six months after the end of their fiscal years to turn in their paperwork, said Louisiana legislative auditor Daryl Purpera. Certified public accountants usually conduct the audits, which examine a city's revenue, expenses and compliance with other laws.

Purpera said the mayor has a history of turning in audits late, and is now considered noncompliant.

St. Joseph Mayor Edward Brown said he is aware of the concern about the water and is ""working to solve it.""

Mayor Brown did not return several calls from CNN over several days this month. When approached at his office in St. Joseph, the mayor declined CNN's request for an interview about the town's audits.

When asked to comment on his residents' concerns about the water, the mayor said, ""We are aware of the problem, and we are working to solve it.""

Gov. John Bel Edwards said he has directed the state health department to look into the water problem in St. Joseph.

""The health and safety of the residents of St. Joseph is of utmost concern,"" Edwards said in a statement. ""While the current situation does not pose an immediate health risk to the residents, it does require our attention after years of neglect.""

Purpera, the state legislative auditor, said the neglect in St. Joseph involves much more than just a late audit. He said while the mayor's paperwork is 1 1/2 months late, the problems with St. Joseph's water system go back years.

""The mayor needs to do whatever he needs to do to fix the water system. That's not just getting the audit done; that's getting contractors lined up,"" Purpera said.

""The audit is about accountability. ... He's basically not providing transparency and accountability.""

Once the mayor submits his audit and has contractors selected, Purpera said, the town will immediately be able to access $1.2 million of the $6 million in state funding. The rest would be awarded as it becomes available.

As for the final $2 million needed to overhaul St. Joseph's infrastructure, the town could apply for grants or loans, state health department spokeswoman Samantha Faulkner said.

St. Joseph resident Carmen Bates said she doesn't want to blame anyone -- she just wants her water clear.

""Everybody's trying to do something, and nobody's accomplishing anything,"" Bates said.

Where does the iron come from?

Most of St. Joseph's iron comes from its water source -- a Mississippi River aquifer, Faulkner said. Corroded iron pipes also contribute to high levels of iron.

When state engineers inspected St. Joseph's water system in December, they found four major deficiencies -- all related to infrastructure, Faulkner said. She said the mayor is ultimately responsible for the town's water system.

St. Joseph residents have lived through at least 20 boil-water advisories in the last four years. And they're frustrated.

About 33% of St. Joseph is under the poverty line. Residents say they've grappled with dirty water for years.

The state says the number of boil-water advisories in St. Joseph is not uncommon.

""We've had 37 systems that have had that or more (boil advisories) over the past four years, so it's not more so than other systems,"" Guidry said.

About 39% of local water systems in Louisiana have high iron levels, Faulkner said. And half of those places don't have iron removal or separation treatment.

The main problem: cost.

""A lot of these treatments can be cost-prohibitive, especially if they're not for health reasons, they're for aesthetic reasons,"" Faulkner said.

She said St. Joseph's water is one of the more extreme cases of high iron levels in the state.

It's not just St. Joseph and Flint

Dirty water doesn't only strike small towns like St. Joseph.

Many cities have World War I-era plumbing and treatment facilities that might not be able to handle contaminants produced in densely populated areas, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.

The American Society of Civil Engineers said the country has an estimated 240,000 water main breaks each year.

Of course, replacing old infrastructure across the country would come at a massive cost. American cities and towns faced an annual shortfall of at least $11 billion to replace infrastructure to meet federal regulations, the Natural Resources Defense Council said, citing a 2009 study from the civil engineers organization.

""It's an ongoing race that cities all over the country are constantly needing to dig up and replace and fix that infrastructure,"" said Josh Mogerman, spokesman for the NRDC.

Colby Nagem, owner of the Fish Tale Grill, says the water in St. Joseph is driving down property values. He says some people buy very inexpensive houses in St. Joseph and move the houses to nearby communities.

The nonprofit American Water Works Association says it would cost $1 trillion over 25 years to restore and expand aging water systems across the country to meet the needs of a growing population.

""Much of our drinking water infrastructure ... is nearing the end of its useful life and approaching the age at which it needs to be replaced,"" the association said in a report.

But cities can only do so much, Mogerman said. Most cities can only replace the pipes they own.

Any troublesome pipes between, say, the street and a kitchen faucet would belong to the homeowner. And if lines are lead, there's not much the city can do about it.

The Natural Resources Defense Council said relatively few cities violate national standards for drinking water, but this is more a result of weak standards than it is of low contaminant levels.

The EPA regularly examines the list of nonregulated contaminants and evaluates whether certain contaminants need to be regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA spokeswoman Monica Lee said.

The cost of dirty water

For a town with about 33% of its residents under the poverty line, paying for bottled water means pouring money down the drain.

Cephus said she spends between $100-$125 a month on bottled water for her family. That's on top of her monthly water bill of about $50.

""That doesn't seem fair to me ... that people are paying for water that they can only use to flush the toilet,"" Boyte said.

When the water looks especially filthy, Boyte drives 1 1/2 hours to his parents' or grandparents' home to shower or do laundry.

Elvadus Fields says he can't afford to move.

In his own pristine white, antebellum house, he keeps bottles filled with murky brown water from the faucet. Silt and sediment has settled at the bottom of two bottles.

""You look at that, and you think, 'Wow, gosh, you know, what would that do to my kidney or my liver?'"" he said. ""The body can't filter that kind of stuff out.""

Fields said he would love to leave St. Joseph -- but can't.

Reginald Gray, 26, buys bottled water to bathe his 5-month-old son.

""If I was financially able, I would move from here,"" the retiree said. ""I'm just not financially able to buy another house at this (stage) in our lives.""

At the town's lone grocery store, Mac's Fresh Market, shoppers chat about high school basketball as they push carts filled with bottled water. Produce manager Reginald Gray said he won't touch the tap water. He buys bottled water from the store to bathe his 5-month-old son.

So what will happen when his son gets old enough to shower on his own?

""Hopefully, I'm gone by that time,"" he said. ""Or they at least fix the water.""

In the meantime, Boyte said, St. Joseph will continue to lag behind much of the country.

""The fact that in 2016, we're allowing this to happen, where we have Third World communities in the United States that have to deal with poor water quality, to me is unreal.""",2016-02-23 00:00:00,"[Holly Yan, Tessa Carletta]"

Battle Mountain, Nevada (CNN) Many Americans listened to the sales pitch of the nation's most powerful conservative voices during the last recession. And then they acted: They bought and stockpiled gold.

This small town roughly half way between Reno and Salt Lake City would like to thank them for that.

""Without the mines, we probably wouldn't even be here,"" says Jodi Moore, a local insurance agent and the vice president of the local Chamber of Commerce. ""That's what keeps us going.""

As many towns this size grew dilapidated in the face of overwhelming economic hardship, Battle Mountain, Nevada -- population, 3,635 -- thrived. They built a new football field, a new wing on the hospital, and, being the seat of Lander County, a new courthouse.

Not bad for a town so small it doesn't have any traffic lights. It did used to have a 4-way blinking yellow light until a semi truck crashed into it a few years ago. It was never replaced.

128,"The future of Britain's offshore oil industry hangs in the balance as losses mount and investment collapses.

A new report by Oil & Gas UK predicts that 43% of British oil fields in the North Sea will lose money this year if oil prices remain around $30 per barrel.

The trade association expects spending on new oil projects will fall below £1 billion ($1.4 billion) in 2016, compared to £8 billion ($11.3 billion) in a typical year.

""We are an industry at the edge of a chasm,"" said Deirdre Michie, CEO of Oil & Gas UK, in a statement.

Crude prices are currently trading around $33 per barrel after falling by about 70% since the summer of 2014.

The industry is awash with excess oil. Slowing demand growth, and the decision by OPEC -- led by Saudi Arabia -- to keep producing at near record levels, is keeping markets oversupplied.

Related: Oil investment weakest in 30 years

Saudi Arabia and Russia recently agreed to freeze oil output. But that agreement alone is unlikely to boost prices much in the near term.

Data from energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy shows it costs British producers about $52 to pump a barrel of oil, on average. Saudi and Russian average production costs are much lower, at $9.90 and $17.20 respectively.

Related: What it costs to produce oil

The U.K. oil industry has been partly sheltered from the price collapse by falling costs. And production actually rose in 2015, although revenues fell 30% to £18 billion.

Oil & Gas UK expects producers will cut costs further in 2016, but says they will also need tax breaks to stay competitive.

Michie urged the British government to cut taxes on the industry to support hundreds of thousands of jobs and ensure the country retains a secure supply of energy.

129,"(CNN) The Justice Department, in a court filing late Monday, accused Apple of suddenly changing its legal position on cooperating with federal law enforcement after years of complying with court orders based on a broad 1789 law.

The filing came in a Brooklyn case involving a methamphetamine dealer. The Drug Enforcement Administration sought Apple's help to break into a phone owned by the suspect, Jun Feng. Despite a guilty plea by Feng, the government says it still needs access to the phone data as part of an ongoing investigation.

It's separate from another case in California, where the FBI won a judge's order to force Apple to assist investigators in breaking into the iPhone of one of the terrorists who killed 14 people in a December shooting attack in San Bernardino.

But the seeds of the government's fight with Apple were sown in the Brooklyn courtroom of U.S. Magistrate Judge James Orenstein.

The government is basing its authority in both cases on the All Writs Act. In recent decades, judges have allowed the government to use the law to require phone companies to assist law enforcement conducting investigations; more recently judges have extended its scope to cover companies like Apple.

The pharmaceutical firm said in a statement late Monday that roughly $58 million in sales to now defunct pharmacy Philidor will have to be shifted to 2015 from 2014.

This means Valeant will delay filing its annual 2015 report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Shares plunged 7% in after-hours trading Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company might have to restate some financial results when it finishes an internal investigation, although they recovered some of those losses on Tuesday.

Valeant (VRX) had hired a high-powered law firm to review its relationship with Philidor. The company severed ties with Philidor last year and has been accused of using the pharmacy to generate ""phantom sales."" Valeant has denied those claims.

Valeant also disclosed that interim CEO Howard Schiller had sold 54,000 shares of the company's stock on Thursday for $4.9 million. The company filing said the sale was ""to cover certain tax obligations."" Shares have plunged 17% between the time of the sale and the close of trading on Monday.

A Wells Fargo analyst came out with a critical research note on the company on Friday, which helped cause the sell-off.

Valeant stock has been struggling since October when a short-selling firm accused the company of massive fraud, similar to what doomed Enron. Federal prosecutors are investigating the way it prices and distributes drugs.

Schiller said the company is working to get back on track.

137,"Artificial intelligence will eventually solve some of the world's biggest problems -- but it'll take some smart humans to get it there.

Quoc Le, a software engineer at Google Brain, is one such human.

Google Brain focuses on ""deep learning,"" a part of artificial intelligence. Think of it as a sophisticated type of machine learning, which is the science of getting computers to learn from data.

Deep learning uses multiple layers of algorithms, called neural networks, to process images, text and sentiments quickly and efficiently.

The idea is for machines to eventually be able to make decisions as humans do. But we're far from that point today, according to a recent Quora post by Andrew Ng, a cofounder of Google Brain.

Related: She's recycling carbon dioxide and reducing oil dependence

Launched in 2011, Google Brain was originally an initiative within the secretive, futuristic Google X division. It has since graduated and is now housed in the company's research department. While Google publishes research from Brain, it remains relatively tight-lipped about the team's organizational structure. Google would not disclose how many work on the team today, citing that the teams are fluid.

34-year-old Le, who has a PhD from Stanford in computer science, has been working at Google Brain for 4.5 years.

""There's very few people in the world that actually understand how to get machines to learn and think,"" said Le, who is originally from Vietnam. ""Deep learning is still new.""

But as deep learning develops, people get more excited about its potential to tackle big problems like education or climate change. For example, using remote sensors, environmental data around the world can be tracked. Right now, that data is largely unprocessed, but deep learning could be used to understand patterns and point to solutions.

""I'm confident deep learning isn't going to 'plateau' anytime soon and that it'll continue to grow rapidly,"" Ng wrote on Quora. Ng now works as chief scientist at Baidu.

Alphabet (GOOG) -- the parent company of Google -- has integrated Google Brain technology into some of its own services. Speech recognition technology in its Android operating systems and improved photo search capabilities originated at Brain.

Google open-sourced its deep learning code, TensorFlow, to the public in a bid to help accelerate the development of artificial intelligence. In 2014, it acquired DeepMind Technologies for $650 million in a bid to beef up its own AI expertise

According to CB Insights, startups working on deep learning and artificial intelligence have raised more than $950 million in the past five years.

Google Brain alum Olcan Sercinoglu is running one of those startups. A software engineer, Sercinoglu left Google Brain in 2014 to launch Scaled Inference.

The firm is working to bring machine learning to the masses with intelligent software. It hasn't launched its product yet, but just a few months after incorporating, Sercinoglu closed $13.6 million in funding from investors like Tencent Holdings, SV Angel and Khosla Ventures.

He credits Google Brain -- which is known for its cutting-edge work -- for helping him complete such a successful round.

""I think having worked at Google Brain was a big factor,"" he said, adding that deep learning and neural networks are just one aspect of the technology his firm is developing.

139,"Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued his most definitive statement on Tuesday: There will be no Supreme Court nominee confirmed in President Barack Obama's final year in office.

In a sharply worded statement on the Senate floor, McConnell bluntly warned the White House that the GOP-controlled Senate would not act on anyone he chooses to sit on the high court.

""Presidents have a right to nominate just as the Senate has its constitutional right to provide or withhold consent,"" McConnell said. ""In this case, the Senate will withhold it.""

The announcement prompted sharp criticism from Democrats, who contended that the GOP-led Senate was failing to do its job and would be risking its tenuous hold on the majority in the fall elections.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said McConnell was taking his marching orders from Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, who had called on the Senate to delay consideration of any nominee.

""That's exactly what the Republican leader is doing: Delay, delay, delay,"" Reid said. He angrily added that ""333 days isn't enough to do the work that we do ordinarily do in 67 days.""

But Democrats are uncertain over whether to bottle-up the Senate in retaliation for the GOP's hardball move. And for the second day in a row, Vice President Joe Biden is center stage as Senate Republican leaders are growing increasingly confident they can unite their party behind a hard-ball strategy to block any consideration of an Obama nominee.

Republicans are seizing on old Democratic talking points -- focused namely on then-Sen. Joe Biden -- to make their case against confirmation proceedings.

The latest revelation: A June 1992 interview Biden gave to The Washington Post, arguing against confirmation hearings of a prospective nominee by President George H.W. Bush to the nation's highest court.

""If someone steps down, I would highly recommend the President not name someone, not send a name up,"" Biden, then the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, told the newspaper, noting how close it was to the November elections.

""If (Bush) did send someone up, I would ask the Senate to seriously consider not having a hearing on that nominee,"" Biden had said.

READ: 'Biden rules' cited in GOP senators' wrangle over Supreme Court

The comments from the nearly 24-year-old interview came after Republicans seized on a clip Monday of Biden making similar comments on the Senate floor. In response, Biden pushed back and said the GOP was taking his comments out of context.

""In the same statement critics are pointing to today, I urged the Senate and White House to work together to overcome partisan differences to ensure the court functions as the Founding Fathers intended,"" Biden said in a Monday statement. ""That remains my position today.""

Nevertheless, the comments gave new ammunition to the hardening GOP lines against anyone the President sends to Capitol Hill.

Republicans are worried that giving the new nominee an opportunity to present his or her case before a national audience will only give the White House momentum in confirming a nominee to replace the late Antonin Scalia, tipping the balance of the court. But it could present bad optics, especially if the nominee is viewed as highly qualified and Republicans refuse to meet with him or her.

Emerging from a leadership meeting Monday evening, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican and member of the Judiciary Committee, flatly said ""no"" when asked if the Senate should convene hearings, saying voters in November should render the judgment.

McConnell said on the floor Monday night that he and Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley were unified against Obama sending anyone up. Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, a swing GOP vote and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, came out Monday against confirming anyone this year.

And some vulnerable Republicans were prepared to side with their party's leadership as well, a heartening development for the Senate GOP.

""I think we should not confirm someone this year, I think we should let the people weigh in,"" said Sen. Rob Portman, a vulnerable Republican up for reelection from the battleground state of Ohio. ""The credibility of the court will be enhanced by that, too.""

The Senate Republican members of the committee plan to huddle Tuesday morning in McConnell's office before a lunch with the full GOP Conference, where party leaders expect the party to be mostly unified.

But at the same time, two moderate Republicans -- Sens. Mark Kirk of Illinois and Susan Collins of Maine -- support holding hearings, giving Democrats confidence divisions are bound to grow in the GOP ranks once a nominee is proposed.

""We should take this process one step at a time as we always do under the regular order,"" Collins told CNN. ""I would expect that there would be a hearing on a nominee when it's sent to us for our consideration... The hearing would help me make a better decision.""",2016-02-23 00:00:00,"[Ted Barrett, Manu Raju, Tom Lobianco]"

141,"PBS is setting up a 24/7 television channel and web stream for its kids shows.

The channel, to be named later, is an expansion of its existing PBS Kids franchise, which includes daytime programming and an on-demand streaming service.

The theory goes something like this: Yes, many kids are accustomed to watching shows on their own schedules, but there's still a market for a traditional ""live"" feed of their favorite shows.

Sometimes viewers want to ""lean forward"" and choose what to watch, Netflix-style; other times they want to ""lean back"" and let someone else program a channel for them. PBS Kids already offers the former option on its web site; now it'll offer the latter option too.

The publicly-funded broadcaster focuses on reaching low-income families who may not have high speed Internet access. To that end, the new channel will increase access to children's programming over the public airwaves.

PBS stations across the country will be able to broadcast it as a digital subchannel (If your main PBS station is 9.1, the kids programming could be on 9.2.). Some of PBS's bigger stations already have something like this for children's programming, but most do not.

The channel will also be streamed on the PBS Kids web site and app, which opens the door to Internet-connected TVs through Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast and other streaming devices.

PBS executives announced the channel on Tuesday. It will launch later in the year.

""Given that 54% of all children nationwide do not have the opportunity to attend preschool, providing access is a critical element of our public service mission,"" PBS CEO Paula Kerger said in a statement.

As any fan of ""Reading Rainbow"" knows, PBS stations already carry shows for kids during the daytime. But the organization wants to fill a need later in the day — ""during primetime and other after-school hours when viewing among families is high,"" it says.

Related: Netflix's strategy: shows for every age

PBS increasingly finds itself in competition with streaming services like Netflix and other entrants like HBO, which recently struck a deal with Sesame Workshop to carry new episodes of ""Sesame Street.""

The HBO deal lets PBS stations show the episodes nine months later.

PBS says the forthcoming channel will have a wide variety of other shows, including ""Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,"" ""Wild Kratts,"" ""Dinosaur Train,"" and ""Odd Squad.""

Down the road, PBS is planning to add interactivity to the live stream, letting viewers switch from a TV show to an educational game and then back to the show.
